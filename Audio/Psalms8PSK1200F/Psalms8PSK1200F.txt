COMPNSED IN ONE BOOKLET. . . . THE PSALTER IS THE BOOK OF ALL SAINTS, AND EVERYONE, WHATEVER HIS SITUATION MAY BE.

IT WAS HIS DAILY PRAYER BOOK AS A MONK, THE TOPIC OF HIS INITIAL LECTURES AS A PROFES SOR. AND AN IMPORTANT PART OF HIS PIETY. THE FIRST BOOK HE OFFERED FOR PUBLICATION WAS A TRANSLATION AND EXPLANATION OF THE SEVEN PENITENTIAL PSALMS (6. 32, 38, 51, 102, 130, 143). BY THE TIME LUTHER COMPLETED HIS GERMAN TRANSLATION OF THE BIBLE, HE HAD PUBLISHED SIX SEPARATE EDITIONS OF THE PSALTER. HIS LECTURES AND COMMENTARIES ON THE PSALMS ALSO FILL FIVE VOLUMES IN THE AMERICAN EDITION OF LUTHER'S WORKS. IN ALL HIS WRITINGS, HOWEVER, LUTHER PREPARED ONLY ONE WORK THAT COMMENTED ON ALL 150 PSALMS. THIS WORK, THE SUMMARIES OF THE PSALMS , |5I7, WAS PUBLISHED IN 1532 AND AGAIN IN 1533 AS A COMPANION FOR HIS FINAL COMPREHENSIVE REVISION OF THE PSALTER (1531). WITH HIS SHORT INTRODUCTIONS TO THE PSALMS, LUTHER ALLOWS US A GLIMPSE INTO HIS THEOLOGY AND INTO HIS PRAYER LIFE. HE SHOWS THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THE PSALTER AS A CHRIST-CENTERED BOOK AND SHOWS HOW HE PRAYED EACH PSALM AS A CHRISTIAN PRAYER. LUTHERS SUMMARIES DEMONSTRATE HIS TWOFOLD APPROACH TO THE PSALMS. FIRST, HE CLASSIFIES EACH AS A PSALM OF PROPHE CY, INSTRUCTION, COMFORT, PRAYER, OR THANKSOR SOME COMBI NATION OF THE ABOVE. FOR LUTHER, THE PSALMS CARRIED THEIR CONTENT BEYOND THE ORIGINAL WRITER AND ORIGINAL SETTING. THEY ARE WORDS OF PROPHECY, INSTRUCTION, COMFORT, PRAYER, AND THANKS FOR US TODAY. SECOND, LUTHER ASSIGNS EACH PSALM TO ONE OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS AND TO ONE OF THE PETITIONS OF THE LORDS PRAYER. HE SAYS THAT THE PSALMS BELONG TO, FLOW FROM, OR EVEN ARE IN THESE PETITIONS AND COMMANDMENTS. IN ACTUAL PRACTICE, HE RELATED NEARLY ALL THE PSALMS TO THE FIRST THREE 9 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER COMMANDMENTSHAVING ONE GOD, HONORING HIS NAME, HEARING HIS WORDAND TO THE FIRST THREE PETITIONSCON CERNING GODS NAME, HIS KINGDOM, AND HIS WILL. THE OTHER COMMANDMENTS AND PETITIONS MERELY FILL OUT WHAT THESE FIRST THREE EXPRESS. LUTHER DISCONTINUED THIS SECOND CLASSIFI CATION SCHEME AFTER PSALM 31. IN A LONG COMMENT AT THAT POINT, HE DECLARES THAT THE READER HAS SEEN ENOUGH EXAMPLES TO UNDERSTAND THE INSIGHT THAT THE PSALMIST AND EVERY CHRISTIAN CAN FIND IN THE TEN COMMANDMENTS AND THE LORDS PRAYER. LUTHERS APPROACH TO THE PSALMS IS NOTABLE, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IT IS CHRIST CENTERED. FOR HIM. ALL ASPECTS OF CHRISTIAN LIFE, INCLUDING THE PSALMS, RELATE TO CHRIST. EVEN THE PSALMISTS DOWN-TO-EARTH REQUESTS FOR PROTECTION AND THANKS FOR DELIVERANCE LUTHER APPLIED TO HIS OWN CIRCUM STANCES AND LIFE AS A CHRISTIAN. THE PSALMISTS ASKED FOR BLESSINGS AND GAVE THANKS FOR BLESSINGS AS MEMBERS OF THE COVENANT PEOPLE OF GOD, RELYING ON GODS GRACE, TRUSTING HIS PROMISES, WORSHIPING IN HIS TEMPLE, RECEIVING HIS FOR GIVENESS. YET ALL OF THESECOVENANT, GRACE, PROMISE, TEM PLE, FORGIVENESSFOUND THEIR FULFILLMENT IN JESUS CHRIST. CHRIST IS HIMSELF THE GOD WHOM WE ARE EXHORTED TO WOR SHIP. WHEN THE PSALMIST EXULTS THAT GODS LOVE ENDURES FOREVER, LUTHER RESPONDS THAT CHRIST STANDS HIDDEN IN THAT PHRASE. THE OLD TESTAMENT PSALMS NOT ONLY PERMIT US TO SEE CHNST IN THEM, THEY REQUIRE IT RESURRECTION, ETERNITY, A UNI VERSAL KINGDOM, FORGIVENESS, EVEN GRACE AND BLESSING EACH ULTIMATELY HAS ITS HOME AND ITS FULFILLMENT IN JESUS CHNST. TO BE FAITHFUL TO THE WITNESS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT AN TO THE WITNESS OF THE PSALMS THEMSELVES IS TO FIND CHRIST THROUGHOUT THE PSALTER. CHRIST FULFILLS ITS PROMISES AND COM FORT WITH HIS LIFE HE TNVITES TO HIMSELF THE PRAYERS AND WORSHIP THE PSALMS SPEAK ABOUT. FINALLY, THE PSALMS THAT REQUIRE HOLINESS AND RIGHTEOUSNESS TO BE PRAYED ARIGHT ARE PRAYERS THAT NO ONE CAN OFFER UNLESS COVERED BY GRACE AND PREFACE FORGIVENESS, BUT GRACE AND FORGIVENESS ARE ULTIMATELY GIFTS OF JESUS CHRIST. THIS LITTLE BOOK DRAWS TOGETHER SEVERAL RESOURCES. THE TEXT OF THE PSALMS IS DRAWN FROM THE ENGLISH STANDARD VERSION BIBLE. THE TRANSLATION OF LUTHERS SUMMARIES IS BASED ON THE WEIMAR EDITION, VOL. 38, AND THE ST. LOUIS EDITION, VOL. 4. FOR THIS DEVOTIONAL PRESENTATION, SOME OF LUTHERS REFERENCES TO THE SPECIFIC ADVERSARIES OF HIS DAY HAVE BEEN OMITTED AND SOME OF HIS SHORTER SUMMARIES HAVE BEEN SUPPLEMENTED WITH COMMENTS FROM HIS OTHER WRITINGS. THE PRAYERS THAT ACCOMPANY EACH PSALM FIRST APPEARED IN BOOK OF DEVOTION: THE PSALMS COMPILED BY REV. F. KUEGELE THEY HAVE BEEN REVISED FOR THIS EDITION. FOR THOSE WHO MAY DESIRE TO SING THESE ANCIENT HYMNS, THEY HAVE BEEN POINTED, AND THE PSALM TONES FROM LUTHERAN SERVICE BOOK- ALTAR BOOK HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR EASY REFERENCE. AT THE CONCLUSION OF HIS SUMMARIES, LUTHER REQUESTED: IF ANYONE IS PLEASED WITH MY POOR ASSISTANCE BY THESE SUMMARIES, 1 ASK THE HE NOT INSERT THEM INTO THE PSALTER BETWEEN THE PSALMS. WE ARE OVERRULING THIS REQUEST AS CONCORDIA PUBLISHING HOUSE DID A CENTURY AGO (WHEN IT PRINTED THE ALTENBERGER BIBELWERK), CONFIDENT THAT LUTHERS ADVICE ON READING THE PSALMS CAN HELP CHRISTIANS TODAY FIND THEIR WAY TO SOME OF THE RICHES OF THE PSALTER. LUTHER, HOWEVER, WAS FIRM ABOUT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT: I PREFER TO SEE THE TEXT STAND ALONE BY ITSELF, UNMIXED WITH ANY THING ELSE. SOME OF THESE SUMMARIES ARE REALLY BRIEF COMMENTARY, AND IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER IF, PLACED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TEXT, THESE SUM- MANES WOULD LOOM LARGER THAN THE PSALMS THEMSELVES. WITH THIS, MAY GOD BLESS YOU. AMEN. THE PUBLISHER READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHTR PSALMS THE PSALMS ARE POINTED FOR SINGING. EACH PSALM VERSE IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS, WITH AN ASTERISK ( ) INDICATING THE POINT OF DIVISION. MOST OF THE TEXT OF EACH HALF VERSE IS SUNG TO A RECITING TONE (A). AT THE POINT OF THE VERTICAL LINE (I) THE FINAL TWO OR THREE SYLLABLES ARE SUNG TO THE NOTES PROVIDED. ORDINARILY THERE IS ONE SYLLABLE OF TEXT FOR EACH NOTE. WHEN THERE ARE ONLY TWO SYLLABLES, THE FIRST SYLLABLE IS SUNG TO TWO NOTES. ANY PSALM CAN BE SUNG TO ANY TONE. IT IS BEST, HOWEVER, THAT THE TONE, WHICH CAN RANGE FROM CHEERFUL AND BRIGHT TO SOMBER AND AUSTERE, BE APPROPRIATE TO THE TEXT. TRADITIONALLY, THE GLORIA PATRI HAS BEEN USED AS THE CLOS ING FOR THE RECITATION AND PRAYING OF THE PSALMS AS A WAY TO GIVE A CHRISTIAN INTERPRTATION TO THESE ANCIENT HYMNS. IT HAS BECOME A FAMILIAR PART OF THE WAY A CHRISTIAN PRAYS THE PSALMS. WHILE THE PRAYERS THAT FOLLOW EACH PSALM INCLUDED HERE CLEARLY AND BEAUTIFULLY POINT TO JESUS CHRIST, WE DO NOT INTEND TO DISCOURAGE THE USE OF THE GLORIA PAIN. IT IS PRINTED HERE FOR YOUR EASE OF REFERENCE: GLORY BE TO THE FATHER AND 1 TO THE SON AND TO THE HOLY I SPIRIT AS IT WAS IN THE THE BE -1 GINNING, IS NOW, AND WILL BE FOREVER. I AMEN. SINGING THE PSALM.S READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER LUTHERS  | THE ENTIRE PSALTER MAY BE TREATED IN A FIVE FOLD FASHION, THAT IS, WE MAY DIVIDE IT INTO FIVE GROUPS. CTRST, SOME PSALMS PROPHESY. THEY SPEAK, FOR EXAMPLE, OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH OR WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE SAINTS. THIS CLASS INCLUDES ALL THE PSALMS THAT CONTAIN PROMISES AND WARNINGS PROMISES FOR THE GODLY AND WARNINGS FOR THE UNGODLY. CJECOND, THERE ARE PSALMS OF INSTRUCTION, WHICH TEACH US WHAT WE SHOULD DO AND WHAT WE SHOULD AVOID, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF GOD. THIS CLASS INCLUDES ALL THE PSALMS THAT CON DEMN HUMAN DOCTRINES AND PRAISE THE WORD OF GOD. JHIRD, THERE ARE PSALMS OF COMFORT, WHICH STRENGTHEN AND COMFORT THE SAINTS IN THEIR TROU BLES AND SORROWS BUT REBUKE AND TERRIFY THE GRANTS. THIS CLASS INCLUDES ALL THE PSALMS THAT ST,MU ' A, E " DURANCE '  R REBUKE W E SJTRSR THE PSALMS OFPMYER - IN WHICH WE CALL ON GOD. PRAYING M ALL KINDS OF DISTRESS TO THIS CLASS BELONG ALL THE PSALMS THAT LAMENT OR MOURN OR CRY OUT AGAINST OUR FOES. LUTHERS INTRODUCTION IFLH. ARE THE PSALMS OF THANKS, IN WHICH GOD IS PRAISED AND GLORIFIED FOR ALL HIS BLESSINGS AND HELP. THIS CLASS INCLUDES ALL THE PSALMS THAT PRAISE GOD FOR HIS WORKS. THESE ARE THE PSALMS OF THE FIRST RANK, AND FOR THEIR SAKE THE PSALTER WAS CREATED THEREFORE IT IS CALLED IN HEBREW SEFER TEHILLIM, THAT IS, A PRAISE BOOK OR BOOK OF THANKSGIVING. WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE PSALMS, WITH ALL THEIR VERSES, CANNOT ALWAYS BE CLASSIFIED SO PRECISELY AND EXACTLY INTO THESE GROUPS. AT TIMES ONE PSALM MIGHT CONTAIN TWO, THREE, OR EVEN ALL FIVE CLASSIFICATIONS, SO THAT ONE PSALM MAY BELONG IN ALL FIVE DIVISIONS, WITH PROPHECY, INSTRUCTION, COMFORT, PRAYER, AND THANKSGIVING LYING NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER. HOWEVER, IT IS THE INTENTION THAT THE READER MAY UNDERSTAND THAT THE PSALTER DEALS WITH THESE FIVE TOPICS THE CLASSIFI CATIONS ARE A HELP, SO THAT WE MIGHT MORE EASILY UNDERSTAND THE PSALTER, BECOME ADAPTED TO IT. AND ALSO BE ABLE TO LEARN AND KEEP IT. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 2 CSALR PSALM 1 'SALM 1 IS A PSALM OF COMFORT. IT ADMONISHES US TO GLADLY HEAR AND LEARN GODS WORD AND BRINGS US THE COMFORT THAT, IN SO DOING, WE WILL HAVE MANY AND GREAT BENEFITS. JUST AS A PALM TREE BY THE WATER GROWS GREEN AND BRINGS FRUIT DESPITE ALL HEAT AND COLD AND THE LIKE, SO ALSO ALL OUR WORDS AND WORKS WILL PROSPER DESPITE ALL ENEMIES. HUMAN DOC TRINES DO NOT HAVE THIS BENEFIT, AND, AS THE WIND BLOWS THE CHAFF AWAY, SO THEY ALSO PASS AWAY. FOR GOD SAYS THAT THOSE WHO STUDY HIS WORD PLEASE HIM, BUT THE OTHERS HE ALLOWS TO PERISH. THIS PSALM FLOWS FROM THE THIRD COMMANDMENT INDEED, IT IS PART OF THAT COMMANDMENT, FOR THE COMMAND TO HONOR THE SABBATH IS ITSELF THE COMMAND TO HEAR AND LEARN OF GODS WORD. PSALM 1 IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE SECOND AND THIRD PETITIONS OF THE LORDS PRAYER, FOR IN THESE WE PRAY FOR GODS KINGDOM AND HIS WILL, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONVEYED BY HIS WORD. | 1 BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO WALKS NOT IN THE COUNSEL OF THE I WICKED, NOR STANDS IN THE WAY OF SINNERS, NOR SITS IN THE SEAT OF I SCOFFERS 2 BUT HIS DELIGHT IS IN THE LAW I OF THE LORD, AND ON HIS LAW HE MEDITATES I DAY AND NIGHT. 5 HE IS LIKE A TREE PLANTED BY STREAMS OF WATER THAT YIELDS ITS FRUIT IN ITS SEASON, AND ITS LEAF DOES NOT I WITHER.  IN ALL THAT HE DOES, HE I PROSPERS. 4 THE WICKED I ARE NOT SO, BUT ARE LIKE CHAFF THAT THE WIND I DRIVES AWAV. PSALM 2 5 THEREFORE THE WICKED WILL NOT STAND IN THE  JUDGMENT, NOR SINNERS IN THE CONGREGATION OF THE I RIGHTEOUS  FOR THE LORD KNOWS THE WAY OF THE I RIGHTEOUS, BUT THE WAY OF THE WICKED WILL I PERISH. PRAYER O GOD, THANKS AND PRAISE BELONG TO YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE GIVEN US YOUR HOLY WORD. ENLIGHTEN US BY YOUR HOLY SPIRIT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR COUNSEL OF GRACE IN JESUS CHRIST, TO LOVE YOUR WORD, AND TO TAKE DELIGHT IN LEARNING YOUR STATUTES AND WALKING IN YOUR LAW. BESTOW YOUR BLESSING AND PROSPER ITY ON THE WORKS OF OUR HANDS IN OUR CHRISTIAN CALLING AND ALL OUR CONVERSATION. AMEN.  PSALM 2 2 IS A PROPHECY OF CHRIST, THAT HE WOULD SUF FER, AND THROUGH HIS SUFFERING BECOME KING AND LORD OF THE WHOLE WORLD. WITHIN THIS PSALM STANDS A WARNING AGAINST THE KINGS AND LORDS OF THIS WORLD: IF, INSTEAD OF HONORING AND SERVING THIS KING, THEY SEEK TO PERSECUTE AND BLOT HIM OUT, THEY SHALL PERISH. THIS PSALM ALSO CONTAINS THE PROMISE THAT THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THE TRUE KING WILL BE BLESSED. THIS PSALM FLOWS FROM THE FIRST COMMANDMENT, IN WHICH GOD PROMISES TO BE OUR GOD, WHO WILL HELP US IN EVERY TROUBLE AND WILL WORK ALL GOOD FOR USJUST AS HE HAS, THROUGH CHRIST, DELIVERED US FROM SIN, DEATH, AND HELL AND BROUGHT US TO ETERNAL LIFE. THIS BLESSING IS WHAT WE PRAY FOR IN THE SECOND PETITION OF THE LORDS PRAYERTHAT HIS KING DOM COME. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER  1 WHY DO THE I NATIONS RAGE AND THE PEOPLES I PLOT IN VAIN? 2 THE KINGS OF THE EARTH SET THEMSELVES, AND THE RULERS TAKE COUNSEL TO-1 GETHER, AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS ANOINTED. I SAYING. 3 LET US BURST THEIR ! BONDS APART AND CAST AWAY THEIR I CORDS FROM US." 4 HE WHO SITS IN THE I HEAVENS LAUGHS THE LORD HOLDS THEM IN DE-1 RISION. 5 THEN HE WILL SPEAK TO THEM I IN HIS WRATH, AND TERRIFY THEM IN HIS FURY, I SAYING, 6 AS FOR ME, I HAVE I SET MY KING ON ZION, MY I HOLY HILL. 7 1 WILL TELL OF I THE DECREE: THE LORD SAID TO ME, YOU ARE MY SON TODAY I HAVE BE-1 GOTTEN YOU. 8 ASK OF ME, AND I WILL MAKE THE NATIONS YOUR I HERITAGE, AND THE ENDS OF THE EARTH YOUR POS-1 SESSION. 9 YOU SHALL BREAK THEM WITH A I ROD OF IRON AND DASH THEM IN PIECES LIKE A POTTERS I VESSEL." 10 NOW THEREFORE, O I KINGS, BE WISE BE WARNED, O RULERS I OF THE EARTH. 11 SERVE THE I LORD WITH FEAR, AND REJOICE WITH I TREMBLING. 12 KISS THE SON, LEST HE BE ANGRY, AND YOU PERISH IN THE WAY, FOR HIS WRATH IS QUICKLY I KINDLED. BLESS&D ARE ALL WHO TAKE REF-1 UGE IN HIM. PSALM 3 PRAYER THANKS BE UNIO YOU, O LORD JESUS CHNSI, BECAUSE YOU WERE ONCE DEAD, AND BY YOUR BLOOD REDEEMED US FROM SIN AND EVERLASTING TORMENT. WE DESIRE TO SERVE YOU AIL THE DAYS OF OUR LIFE. PRESERVE US IN THE MIDST OF SO MAN) ENEMIES, AND BY YOUR MIGHTY HAND PRESERVE US FOR YOUR ETERNAL KINGDOM! AMEN. C XSALR PSALM 3 SALM 3 IS A PSALM OF PRAYER IN WHICH WE FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF DAVID. HE PRAYED THIS PRAYER IN DISTRESS WHEN HIS SON ABSALOM EXPELLED HIM, AND HIS PRAYER WAS GRANTED TO HIM. AT THE END. DAVID GLORIFIES GOD FOR BEING A TRUE HELPER AND KEEPER FOR ALL OF HIS PEOPLE W HO CALL ON HIM IN DISTRESS. THIS PSALM BELONGS TO THE FIRST COMMANDMENT, THAT GOD WILL BE OUR GOD AND OUR HELP. THE PSALM IS IN THE SEVENTH PETITION OF THE LORDS PRAYER, IN WHICH WE PRAY TO BE DELIVERED FROM ALL EVIL. 3 1 O LORD, HOW MANY I ARE MY FOES! 1 " MANY ARE RISING A- I GAINST ME. 2 MANY ARE SAYING I OF MY SOUL, THERE IS NO SALVATION FOR I HIM IN GOD. 3 BUT YOU. O LORD, ARE A SHIELD A-1 BOUT ME, MY GLORY, AND THE LIFTER I OF MY HEAD.  I CRIED ALOUD I TO THE LORD. AND HE ANSWERED ME FROM HIS I HOLY HILL. |9 KEADINCJ THFC R 5ALMB WL I H LU I HTK S 1 LAY I DOWN AND SLEPT 1 " 1 WOKE AGAIN, FOR THE LORD SUS- I TAMED ME. 6 1 WILL NOT BE AFRAID OF MANY THOUSANDS OF I PEOPLE WHO HAVE SET THEMSELVES AGAINST ME I ALL AROUND. 7 ARISE. O LORD! SAVE ME, O MY GOD! FOR YOU STRIKE ALL MY ENEMIES I ON THE CHEEK YOU BREAK THE TEETH OF THE I WICKED. 8 SALVATION BELONGS I TO THE LORD YOUR BLESSING BE ON YOUR T PEOPLE! PRAYER LORD JESUS CHRIST, SON OF THE LIVING GOD. BE WITH US AS THE SURE DEFENSE OF YOUR CHURCH. DEFEND US AGAINST OUR ENE MIES, PRESERVE US FROM THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE WICKED, AND WHEN OUR LAST HOUR HAS COME, DELIVER US FROM ALL EVIL, BOTH OF BODY AND SOUL, AND RECEIVE US INTO YOUR EVERLASTING KING DOM. AMEN.  77 ) PSALM 4 ALM 4 IS A PSALM OF COMFORT, AND AT THE SAME TIME A PSALM OF PRAYER AND INSTRUCTION THAT TEACHES US TO TRUST IN OD WHEN THINGS GO WRONG. IT REBUKES THE UNGODLY, WHO CONCERN THEMSELVES OVER VAIN GODS AND FLESHLY COMFORT, YET WILL NOT BEAR TO WAIT CONFIDENTLY FOR GOD, WHO IS THE HIGHEST COMFORT. GOD SURPRISES US BY HOW HE DEALS WITH HIS SAINTS. FIRST. HE ABANDONS THEM AND TRIES THEIR FAITH AND PATIENCE. ON THE OTHER HAND ARE THE UNGODLY WHO WANT TO HAVE A FULL AND SECURE BELLY. IF ANYONE TALKS TO THEM ABOUT FAITH AND TIN DESPISE HIM AND " C  THIS FOOL US WHAT IS GOOD? YES. YOU BE PATIENT UNTIL A ROAST CHICK- N FLIES INTO YOUR MOUTH. TRUST IN THAT AND YOU WILL STARVE!" 0 PSALM 4 THIS PSALM BELONGS TO THE FIRST COMMANDMENT IT LEACH ES AND URGES US TO HOPE IN GOD AND ENDURE HARDSHIP AND EVERY NEED WITH PATIENCE, AND IT REBUKES THE FAITHLESS AND IMPATIENT. PSALM 4 IS INCLUDED IN THE THIRD AND SEVENTH PETITIONS, IN WHICH WE PRAY THAT GOD'S WILL BE DONE AND THAT WE BE DELIVERED FROM EVIL. IT CAN ALSO BE IN THE FOURTH PETITION, WHEN WE ASK FOR OUR DAILY BREAD, THAT IS. FOR PEACE AND ALL THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE IN THE FACE OF EVERY EARTHLY NEED. 4 1 ANSWER ME WHEN 1 CALL. O GOD OF MY NGHTEOUSNESS! YOU HAVE GIVEN ME RELIEF WHEN I WAS I IN DISTRESS. BE GRACIOUS TO ME AND I HEAR MY PRAYER! 2 O MEN, HOW LONG SHALL MY HONOR BE TURNED I INTO SHAME? HOW LONG WILL YOU LOVE VAIN WORDS AND SEEK I AFTER LIES? J BUT KNOW THAT THE LORD HAS SET APART THE GODLY I FOR HIMSELF THE LORD HEARS WHEN I I CALL TO HIM. 4 BE ANGRY, AND I DO NOT SIN. PONDER IN YOUR OWN HEARTS ON YOUR BEDS, AND BE I SILENT. 5 OFFER RIGHT SACRI- I FICES, AND PUT YOUR TRUST I IN THE LORD. 6 THERE ARE MANY WHO SAY, WHO WILL SHOW L US SOME GOOD? LIFT UP THE LIGHT OF YOUR FACE UPON US, IO LORD! 7 YOU HAVE PUT MORE JOY I IN MY HEART  THAN THEY HAVE WHEN THEIR GRAIN AND I WINE ABOUND. 8 IN PEACE I WILL BOTH LIE I DOWN AND SLEEP FOR YOU ALONE, O LORD, MAKE ME DWELL IN I SAFETY. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PRAYER O GOD, OUR MERCIFUL FATHER IN HEAVEN, FILL OUR HEARTS WITH PATIENCE UNDER THE CROSS, STRENGTHEN OUR FAITH, AND SO GOVERN US THAT WE GIVE OFFENSE TO NONE, NEITHER IN WORD NOR DEED. GRANT US ALSO THIS DAY ALL THAT WE NEED FOR BODY AND SOUL. AMEN. PSALM 5 C-SALM 5 IS A PSALM OF PRAYER AGAINST THE FALSE TEACH ERS AND THE REBELLIOUS SPIRITS. IT HARSHLY CONDEMNS BOTH THEIR GLISTENING TEACHING AND THEIR WORKS, BY WHICHUNDER THE NAME OF GODTHEY DO GREAT HARM TO THE PURE WORD OF GOD AND THE TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD. THE PSALM PRAYS FOR THE RIGH TEOUS, THAT IS, FOR THE PURE WORD OF GOD AND THE PURE WOR SHIP OF GOD. IN THE LAST VERSE IT PROMISES THAT SUCH A PRAYER WILL BE HEARD AND THE REBELLIOUS SPIRITS WILL BE CONDEMNED. THIS PSALM BELONGS TO THE SECOND AND THIRD COMMAND MENTS, IN WHICH WE ARE COMMANDED TO KEEP BOTH GODS NAME AND GODS WORD HOLY. IT BELONGS TO THE FIRST AND SECOND PETITIONS OF THE LORDS PRAYER, IN WHICH WE PRAY THAT GOD S NAME, HONOR, AND KINGDOM WILL BE ADVANCED. 1 GIVE EAR TO MY WORDS, I O LORD CONSIDER MY I GROANING. 2 GIVE ATTENTION TO THE SOUND OF MY CRY, MY KING I AND MY GOD, FOR TO YOU I DO I PRAY. J O LORD, IN THE MORNING YOU I HEAR MY VOICE  IN (HE MORNING I PREPARE A SACRIFICE FOR I YOUAND WATCH. PSALM S  FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN I WICKEDNESS EVIL MAY NOT I DWELL WITH YOU. S THE BOASTFUL SHALL NOT STAND BE-1 FORE YOUR EYES YOU HATE ALL EVIL-1 DOERS. 6 YOU DESTROY THOSE I WHO SPEAK LIES THE LORD ABHORS THE BLOODTHIRSTY AND DE-1 CEITFUL MAN. 7 BUT I, THROUGH THE ABUNDANCE OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE, WILL EN-1 TER YOUR HOUSE. I WILL BOW DOWN TOWARD YOUR HOLY TEMPLE IN THE I FEAR OF YOU. 8 LEAD ME, O LORD, IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS BECAUSE OF MY I ENEMIES MAKE YOUR WAY STRAIGHT BE-1 FORE ME. 9 FOR THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THEIR MOUTH THEIR INMOST SELF IS DE-1 STRUCTION THEIR THROAT IS AN OPEN GRAVE THEY FLATTER I WITH THEIR TONGUE. 10 MAKE THEM BEAR THEIR GUILT, O GOD LET THEM FALL BY THEIR OWN I COUNSELS BECAUSE OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THEIR TRANSGRESSIONS CAST THEM OUT, FOR THEY HAVE REBELLED A-1 GAINST YOU. " BUT LET ALL WHO TAKE REFUGE IN YOU REJOICE LET THEM EVER I SING FOR JOY, AND SPREAD YOUR PROTECTION OVER THEM, THAT THOSE WHO LOVE YOUR NAME MAY EX-1 ULT IN YOU. 12 FOR YOU BLESS THE RIGHTEOUS, I O LORD YOU COVER HIM WITH FAVOR AS I WITH A SHIELD. PRAYER LORD JESUS CHRIST, YOU ARE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD AND ALONE THE WAY TO ETERNAL LIFE. RESTRAIN THE CORRUPTERS OF YOUR WORD AND ALL THE ENEMIES OF YOUR TRUTH. PRESERVE THE TRUTH OF YOUR GOSPEL IN THESE LATTER DAYS AND IN FAITHFUL TEACHERS WHO WILL LEAD US IN THE WAY EVERLASTING. GRANT US TO SERVE YOU IN STEADFAST FAITH AND A GOOD CONSCIENCE TO OUR END. AMEN. 3 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 6 C  ALM 6 IS A PSALM OF PRAYER. IT LAMENTS THE GREAT YET HIDDEN SUFFERING OF THE CONSCIENCE WHEN, ON ACCOUNT OF SINS, ONES FAITH AND HOPE ARE TORMENTED BY THE LAW AND ANGER OF GOD AND DRIVEN TO DESPAIR OR EMNG FAITH. THIS SUF FERING IS CALLED ELSEWHERE IN THE PSALTER THE BONDS OF DEATH AND THE ROPES OF HELL, OR THE MISERY OF DEATH AND THE ANGUISH OF HELL. AT THE END OF PSALM 6, THE PSALMIST SEES THAT HIS PRAYER HAS BEEN HEARD. HE IS THEREFORE A TRUSTWORTHY EXAMPLE FOR THOSE WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN SUCH AFFLICTION, SO THAT THEY MAY NOT REMAIN IN IT. THE PSALMIST REBUKES THE WORKERS OF EVIL, THAT IS, THE FALSE SAINTS WHO GENERALLY HATE AND PERSECUTE SUCH AFFLICTED PEOPLE. BECAUSE THEIR COMFORT IS IN THEIR OWN HOLINESS, THEY KNOW NOTHING OF THESE TRIALS. THEY ARE THEREFORE UTTER ENEMIES OF THE TRUE FAITH. THIS PSALM BELONGS TO THE FIRST AND SECOND COMMAND MENTS BECAUSE IT COMMENDS THE STRUGGLE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE M GOD AND PRAY AGAINST SIN AND DEATH. IT IS IN THE FIRST PETITION OF THE LORDS PRAYER, AS ARE ALL OTHER PSALMS OF PMYCR, AUSE ITS PRAYER IS THAT GODS NAME BE CALLED UPON NNRL KURORL '  LORD, REBUKE ME NOT IN YOUR L ANGER, NOR DISCIPLINE ME  IN YOUR WRATH. 2 B  GRA CI US LO ME. O LORD, FOR I AM I LANGUISHING HEAL ME. O LORD, FOR MY BONES ARE  TROUBLED. J MY SOUL ALSO IS GREATLY  TROUBLED. BUT YOU, O LORD   HOW LONG? 4 TURN, O LORD, DELIV-  ER MY LIFE SAVE ME FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR L STEADFAST LOVE. PSALM 7 S FOR IN DEATH THERE IS NO REMEM- I BRANCE OF YOU 1  IN SHEOL WHO WILL I GIVE YOU PRAISE? 6 I AM WEARY WITH MY MOANING. EVERY NIGHT I FLOOD MY I BED WITH TEARS I DRENCH MY COUCH WITH MY I WEEPING. 7 MY EYE WASTES AWAY BE- I CAUSE OF GRIEF IT GROWS WEAK BECAUSE OF I ALL MY FOES. 8 DEPART FROM ME, ALL YOU WORKERS OF I EVIL, FOR THE LORD HAS HEARD THE SOUND OF MY I WEEPING. 9 THE LORD HAS I HEARD MY PLEA THE LORD AC- I CEPTS MY PRAYER. 10 ALL MY ENEMIES SHALL BE ASHAMED AND GREATLY L TROUBLED THEY SHALL TUM BACK AND BE PUT TO SHAME IN A I MOMENT. PRAYER O LORD. GOD OF MERCY, FORGIVE US ALL OUR SINS FOR THE SAKE OF THE BITTER SUFFERINGS OF YOUR SON, JESUS CHRIST. GRANT US A TRIUMPHANT FAITH BY WHICH WE MAY OBTAIN THE VICTORY IN ALL AFFLICTIONS AND TEMPTATIONS, AND UPHOLD US BY YOUR GRACE WHEN WE MUST PASS THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH. AMEN. PSALM 7 C  |SALM 7 IS ALSO A PSALM OF PRAYER. IT LAMENTS OVER SLANDERERS WHO ACCUSE THE SAINTS AND THEIR TEACHINGS AS BEING RIOTOUS, OPPOSED TO THE AUTHORITIES, AND DISTURBING THE PEACE. IN THIS WAY SHIMEI THE BENJAMINITE (2 SAMUEL 16:5-14) SLANDERED THE PIOUS DAVID AS IF DAVID HAD STOLEN KING SAUL S KINGDOM. IN THE SAME WAY, CHRIST WAS ALSO ACCUSED BEFORE READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PILATE, AND EVEN NOW SLANDERERS DEFAME THE GOSPEL. DAVID FIGHTS AGAINST THIS AFFLICTION WITH PRAYER AND CRIES TO GOD OF HIS INNOCENCE. BY DAVIDS OWN EXAMPLE, HE SHOWS US THAT SUCH A PRAYER WAS GRANTED, SO THAT WE MIGHT HAVE COMFORT. THE PSALM ALSO THREATENS THE SLANDERERS AND OPPRESSORS AND HOLDS BEFORE THEM THE EXAMPLE OF THOSE WHO PERISH BEFORE THEY ACCOMPLISHED THE EVIL THEY INTENDED. IT BELONGS, LIKE THE PRECEDING PSALM, IN THE SECOND COMMANDMENT AND THE FIRST PETITION. 7 1 O LORD MY GOD, IN YOU DO I TAKE I REFUGE SAVE ME FROM ALL MY PURSUERS AND DE-1 LIVER ME, 2 LEST LIKE A LION THEY TEAR MY I SOUL APART, RENDING IT IN PIECES, WITH NONE TO DE-1 LIVER. 3 O LORD MY GOD, IF I HAVE I DONE THIS, IF THERE IS WRONG I IN MY HANDS, 4 IF I HAVE REPAID MY FRIEND WITH I EVIL OR PLUNDERED MY ENEMY WITH-1 OUT CAUSE, 5 LET THE ENEMY PURSUE MY SOUL AND OVER-1 TAKE IT   HIM TRAMPLE MY UFE T0 THE 8 ROU ND AND LAY MY GLORY I M THE DUST. -- W III YUUR ANGER HF   P AGAI " S  LHE TO OF "Y I ENEMIES AWAKE FOR ME YOU HAVE APPOINTED A I JUDGMENT. 7 LET THE ASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLES BE GATHERED A-1 BOUT YOU OVER IT RE-1 TURN ON HIGH. A  LORD JUDGES THE I PEOPLES JUDG E ME, 0 LORD, ACCORDING TO MY RIGHTEOUSNESS AND ACCORDING TO THE INTEGRITY THAT IS 1 IN ME. 6 PSALM 7  OH, LET THE EVIL OF THE WICKED COME TO AN END. AND MAY YOU ESTABLISH THE I RIGHTEOUS YOU WHO TEST THE MINDS AND HEARTS, O I RIGHTEOUS GOD! 10 MY SHIELD I IS WITH GOD, WHO SAVES THE UP-1 RIGHT IN HEART. 11 GOD IS A I RIGHTEOUS JUDGE, AND A GOD WHO FEELS INDIGNATION I EVRY DAY.  IF A MAN DOES NOT REPENT, GOD WILL I WHET HIS SWORD HE HAS BENT AND READ-1 LED HIS BOW 13 HE HAS PREPARED FOR HIM HIS DEADLY I WEAPONS,' MAKING HIS ARROWS I FIERY SHAFTS. U BEHOLD, THE WICKED MAN CONCEIVES I EVIL" AND IS PREGNANT WITH MISCHIEF AND GIVES I BIRTH TO LIES. 15 HE MAKES A PIT, DIGGING I IT OUT, AND FALLS INTO THE HOLE THAT I HE HAS MADE. 16 HIS MISCHIEF RETURNS UPON I HIS OWN HEAD, AND ON HIS OWN SKULL HIS VIOLENCE I DESCENDS. 17 1 WILL GIVE TO THE LORD THE THANKS DUE TO HIS I RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND 1 WILL SING PRAISE TO THE NAME OF THE LORD, THE I MOST HIGH. PRAYER LORD, OUR GOD, LOVER OF THE TRUTH, HELP THOSE WHO, FOR YOUR NAMES SAKE, ARE LIED AGAINST AND SLANDERED INNOCENTLY. STRENGTHEN, COMFORT, AND UPHOLD THOSE WHO SUFFER WRONGFUL LY, AND BREAK AND HINDER THE CRAFTINESS OF EVIL MEN WHO WOULD SUPPRESS YOUR TRUTH AND DESTROY YOUR KINGDOM. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 8 R  AIM 8 IS A PROPHECY OF CHRISTHIS SUFFERINGS, RESURRECTION, AND KINGLY RULE OVER ALL CREATURES. THIS KING DOM SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BY THE VOICE OF CHILDREN, THAT IS, IT WILL BE ESTABLISHED BY WORD AND FAITH ALONE, NOT BY SWORD OR ARMOR. THIS PSALM BELONGS IN THE FIRST COMMANDMENT, SPECIFICALLY THAT GOD INTENDS TO BE OUR GOD, AND THE SECOND PETITION, AS WAS STATED IN PSALM 2 ABOVE. D? ' O LORD, OUT LORD, HOW MAJESTIC IS YOUR NAME IN I ALL THE EARTH!  YOU HAVE SET YOUR GLORY ABOVE THE I HEAVENS. 2 OUT OF THE MOUTH OF BABES AND INFANTS, YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED STRENGTH BECAUSE I OF YOUR FOES, TO STILL THE ENEMY AND THE A-1 VENGER. 3 WHEN I LOOK AT YOUR HEAVENS, THE WORK OF YOUR I FINGERS, THE MOON AND THE STARS, WHICH YOU HAVE I SET IN PLACE, 4 WHAT IS MAN THAT YOU ARE MIND-1 FUL OF HIM, AND THE SON OF MAN THAT YOU I CARE FOR HIM? 5 YET YOU HAVE MADE HIM A LITTLE LOWER THAN THE HEAVENLY  BEINGS AND CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND L HONOR. 6 YOU HAVE GIVEN HIM DOMINION OVER THE WORKS I OF YOUR HANDS YOU HAVE PUT ALL THINGS UNDER I HIS FEET, 7 ALL SHEEP AND I OXEN, AND ALSO THE BEASTS L OF THE FIELD, PSALM 9 8 THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS, AND THE FISH  OF THE SEA, 1 " WHATEVER PASSES ALONG THE PATHS I OF THE SEAS. 9 OI LORD, OUT LORD, HOW MAJESTIC IS YOUR NAME IN I ALL THE EARTH! PRAYER LORD JESUS, YOU WERE DELIVERED FOR OUR OFFENSES AND RAISED AGAIN FOR OUR JUSTIFICATION. BLESS AND DEFEND YOUR HOLY CHURCH. ENDUE YOUR WORD WITH POWER, STRENGTHEN OUR FAITH, AND AFTER THE SUFFERINGS OF THIS LIFE GRANT US TO CELEBRATE A HAPPY EASTER, RISING AGAIN TO LIVE AND REIGN WITH YOU IN ALL ETERNITY. AMEN. PSALM 9 CSALM 9 IS ALSO A PROPHECY OF THE PEOPLE OF CHRIST, THE HOLY CHRISTIAN CHURCH. THEY SUFFER, FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF CHRIST, AND THEIR BLOOD IS CONTINUALLY BEING SHED. HOWEVER, THE PSALM GIVES THIS PROPHECY THANKFULLY AND COMFORTINGLY, SO THAT IT MIGHT WELL BE CALLED A PSALM OF THANKS AND COMFORT. THE CHRISTIANS (AND ESPECIALLY THE HOLY MARTYRS) HERE THANK GOD AND ARE COMFORTED BY THE FACT THAT GOD NEVER LEAVES THEM. NO, THE MORE THEY ARE PERSECUTED, THE MORE HE MULTIPLIES THEM, AS SOME OF THE PERSECUTORS CONVERT AND BECOME CHRISTIANS AND THE OTHERS PERISH. THIS PSALM BELONGS IN THE FIRST COMMANDMENT AND IN THE SECOND PETITION, AS WAS STATED IN THE PRECEDING PSALM. 9 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 9 1 L WILL GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD WITH MY I WHOLE HEART I WILL RECOUNT ALL OF YOUR WON- I DERFUL DEEDS. 2 1 WILL BE GLAD AND EX-1 ULT IN YOU 1 WILL SING PRAISE TO YOUR NAME. I O MOST HIGH. 3 WHEN MY ENEMIES ! TURN BACK,  THEY STUMBLE AND PERISH BEFORE YOUR I PRESENCE. 4 FOR YOU HAVE MAINTAINED MY I JUST CAUSE YOU HAVE SAT ON THE THRONE, GIVING RIGHTEOUS I JUDGMENT. 5 YOU HAVE REBUKED THE NATIONS YOU HAVE MADE THE WICKED I PERISH YOU HAVE BLOTTED OUT THEIR NAME FOREVER AND I EVER. 6 THE ENEMY CAME TO AN END IN EVERLASTING RUINS THEIR CITIES YOU I ROOTED OUT THE VERY MEMORY OF THEM HAS I PERISHED. 7 BUT THE LORD SITS ENTHRONED FOR-1 EVER HE HAS ESTABLISHED HIS THRONE FOR I JUSTICE, 8 AND HE JUDGES THE WORLD WITH I RIGHTEOUSNESS HE JUDGES THE PEOPLES WITH UP-1 RIGHTNESS. 9 THE LORD IS A STRONGHOLD FOR I THE OPPRESSED, A STRONGHOLD IN TIMES OF I TROUBLE. 10 AND THOSE WHO KNOW YOUR NAME PUT THEIR I TRUST IN YOU, FOR YOU, 0 LORD, HAVE NOT FORSAKEN THOSE WHO I SEEK YOU. W.TH ALL OUR HEARTS WE GIVE THANKS TO YOU. O LORD, BECAUSE AT ALL UMES YOU DWELL WITH YOUR CHRISTIANS AND GRA- NL VT M  FAI,H WH  C NFESS YOUR  URD ' W,TH YOUR GNTCE. INCREASE YOUR CHURCH DADY. AND GRANT US TO BE AND TO TEMATN, TRUE MEM- BERS OF THE SAME TO OUR FINAL END. AMEN. PSALM 9 ' I SING PRAISES LO THE LORD, WHO SILS ENTHRONED IN I ZION! TELL AMONG THE PEOPLES I HIS DEEDS! 12 FOR HE WHO AVENGES BLOOD IS MIND- I FUL OF THEM HE DOES NOT FORGET THE CRY OF THE AF- I FLICTED. ,3 BE GRACIOUS TO ME, I O LORD! SEE MY AFFLICTION FROM THOSE WHO HATE ME, O YOU WHO LIFT ME UP FROM THE I GATES OF DEATH, 14 THAT I MAY RECOUNT ALL YOUR I PRAISES, THAT IN THE GATES OF THE DAUGHTER OF ZION 1 MAY REJOICE IN YOUR SAL- I VATION. 15 THE NATIONS HAVE SUNK IN THE PIT I THAT THEY MADE IN THE NET THAT THEY HID, THEIR OWN FOOT I HAS BEEN CAUGHT. 16 THE LORD HAS MADE HIMSELF KNOWN HE HAS EXECUTED I JUDGMENT THE WICKED ARE SNARED IN THE WORK OF I THEIR OWN HANDS. 17 THE WICKED SHALL RETURN I TO SHEOL, ALL THE NATIONS THAT FOR- I GET GOD. 18 FOR THE NEEDY SHALL NOT ALWAYS BE FOR- I GOTTEN, AND THE HOPE OF THE POOR SHALL NOT PERISH FOR- I EVER. 19 ARISE, O LORD! LET NOT I MAN PREVAIL LET THE NATIONS BE JUDGED BE- I FORE YOU! 20 PUT THEM IN FEAR, I O LORD! LET THE NATIONS KNOW THAT THEY I ARE BUT MEN! PRAYER TEACH US, O LORD, TO KNOW AND TO CONSIDER WHAT A VAIN THING MAN IS, THAT WE MAY WALK BEFORE YOU IN TRUE HUMILITY, NOT TRUSTING IN OURSELVES, BUT SEEKING YOUR GRACE IN YOUR SON. JESUS CHRIST, IN WHOM YOU HAVE PROMISED TO US THE FORGIVENESS OF OUR SINS. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER  PSALM 10 C|SALM 10 IS A PSALM OF PRAYER. IT LAMENTS OVER THE ENEMIES OF THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST WHO TERRIFY CHRISTENDOM WITH FORCE AND CUNNING. THESE ENEMIES DIRECT THE SWORD OF WORLDLY TYRANNY OVER THE BODY AND THE NET OF FALSE LEACHING OVER THE SOUL. HOWEVER, AS IT SAYS IN VERSE 7 (HIS MOUTH IS FILLED WITH CURSING AND DECEIT AND OPPRESSION), THE ENEMIES OF THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST CAN DO NO MORE THAN CURSE, THAT IS, EXCOMMUNICATE AND CONDEMN LIE, THAT IS, BNNG ABOUT FALSE DOCTRINE AND FALSE WORSHIP AND DECEIVE, THAT IS, DELUDE AND MAKE A FOOL OF THE WORLD CONCERNING ITS GOOD, HONOR, POWER, BODY, AND SOUL. BUT IN THE END, THE PSALM SHOWS OUR COM FORT, THAT SUCH ABOMINATION SHALL PERISH WITH THE END OF THE WORLD. THE PSALM BELONGS IN THE SECOND COMMANDMENT AND IN THE FIRST PETITION, AS DO ALL PSALMS OF PRAYER. 1 WHY, O LORD, DO YOU STAND A-1 FAR OFF? WHY DO YOU HIDE YOURSELF IN TIMES OF I TROUBLE? 2 IN ARROGANCE THE WICKED HOTLY PUR-1 SUE THE POOR LET THEM BE CAUGHT IN THE SCHEMES THAT THEY I HAVE DEVISED. 5 FOR THE WICKED BOASTS OF THE DESIRES I OF HIS SOUL, AND THE ONE GREEDY FOR GAIN CURSES AND RENOUNC-1 ES THE LORD. 4 IN THE PRIDE OF HIS FACE THE WICKED DOES NOT I SEEK HIM ALL HIS THOUGHTS ARE, THERE I IS NO GOD. 5 HIS WAYS PROSPER AT ALL TIMES YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE ON HIGH, OUT I OF HIS SIGHT AS FOR ALL HIS FOES, HE I PUFFS AT THEM. PSALM 10 6 HE SAYS IN HIS HEART. I SHALL I NOT BE MOVED THROUGHOUT ALL GENERATIONS I SHALL NOT MEET AD-1 VERSITY 7 HIS MOUTH IS FILLED WITH CURSING AND DECEIT AND OP-1 PRESSION UNDER HIS TONGUE ARE MISCHIEF AND IN-1 IQUITY. 8 HE SITS IN AMBUSH IN THE VILLAGES IN HIDING PLACES HE MURDERS THE I INNOCENT. HIS EYES STEALTHILY WATCH FOR THE I HELPLESS 9 HE LURKS IN AMBUSH LIKE A LION IN HIS THICKET HE LURKS THAT HE MAY I SEIZE THE POOR HE SEIZES THE POOR WHEN HE DRAWS HIM IN-1 TO HIS NET. 10 THE HELP-1 LESS ARE CRUSHED. SINK DOWN, AND FALL I BY HIS MIGHT. N HE SAYS IN HIS HEART, GOD HAS FOR-1 GOTTEN, HE HAS HIDDEN HIS FACE, HE WILL NEVER I SEE IT 12 ARISE, O LORD, O GOD. LIFT I UP YOUR HAND, FORGET NOT THE AF-1 DIETED. 13 WHY DOES THE WICKED RENOUNCE GOD AND SAY I IN HIS HEART, YOU WILL NOT CALL I TO ACCOUNT? 14 BUT YOU DO SEE, FOR YOU NOTE MISCHIEF AND VEXATION, THAT YOU MAY TAKE IT IN-1 TO YOUR HANDS TO YOU THE HELPLESS COMMITS HIMSELF YOU HAVE BEEN THE HELPER OF THE I FATHERLESS. 15 BREAK THE ARM OF THE WICKED AND EVIL-1 DOER CALL HIS WICKEDNESS TO ACCOUNT TILL YOU I FIND NONE. THE LORD IS KING FOREVER AND I EVER THE NATIONS PERISH I FROM HIS LAND. 17 O LORD, YOU HEAR THE DESIRE OF THE AF-1 FLICTED YOU WILL STRENGTH-1 EN THEIR HEART READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER YOU WILL INCLINE YOUR EAR 18 TO DO JUSTICE TO THE FATHERLESS AND I THE OPPRESSED,  SO THAT MAN WHO IS OF THE EARTH MAY STRIKE TER- I ROR NO MORE. PRAYER O LORD, OUR FAITHFUL AND JEALOUS GOD, RESTRAIN THE CRAFTI NESS AND THE POWER, THE OPPRESSION AND THE DECEIT OF YOUR ENEMIES. SAVE THE SOULS OF THE INNOCENT FROM THE SNARES OF FALSEHOOD, AND LEAD THEM TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR SALVATION IN YOUR SON, JESUS CHRIST. KEEP US IN THE TRUE AND SAVING FAITH, AND GRANT US TO WALK WORTHY OF YOUR NAME FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SON, OUR SAVIOR. AMEN. PSALM 11 11TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER. IT LAMENTS OVER THE HERETICS AND FALSE INTERPRETERS OF THE SCRIPTURES WHO LEAD THE PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE TRUE GROUND OF FAITH AND BRING THEM TO THEIR MOUNTAINS, THAT IS, THEIR GREAT HIGH HOLINESS OF WORKS. TO THAT END, THE HERETICS AND FALSE INTERPRETERS OF THE SCRIPTURES MOCK THE TRUE TEACHER AND SAY. WHAT SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS DO? BUT THE PSALM ENDS WITH THE COMFORT THAT GOD WILL CERTAINLY SEE THIS. THE FALSE TEACHERS WILL BE CON DEMNED AND THE RIGHTEOUS WILL REMAIN. THIS PRAYER CAN THUS BE AN EXAMPLE FOR US. THIS PSALM BELONGS IN THE SECOND COMMANDMENT AND THE FIRST PETITION, AS ALL PSALMS OF PRAYER. 9  PSALM 11 || 1 IN THE LORD I TAKE REFUGE HOW CAN YOU SAY I TO MY SOUL,  FLEE LIKE A BIRD TO YOUR I MOUNTAIN, 2 FOR BEHOLD, THE WICKED I BEND THE BOW THEY HAVE FITTED THEIR ARROW TO THE STRING TO SHOOT IN THE DARK AT THE UP- I RIGHT IN HEART 3 IF THE FOUNDATIONS I ARE DESTROYED,  WHAT CAN THE I RIGHTEOUS DO? 4 THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE THE LORDS THRONE IS IN I HEAVEN HIS EYES SEE, HIS EYELIDS TEST, THE CHIL- I DREN OF MAN. 5 THE LORD TESTS THE I RIGHTEOUS,  BUT HIS SOUL HATES THE WICKED AND THE ONE WHO LOVES I VIOLENCE. 6 LET HIM RAIN COALS ON THE I WICKED  FIRE AND SULFUR AND A SCORCHING WIND SHALL BE THE PORTION I OF THEIR CUP. 7 FOR THE LORD IS RIGHTEOUS HE LOVES I RIGHTEOUS DEEDS  THE UPRIGHT SHALL BE- I HOLD HIS FACE. PRAYER LORD JESUS, YOU CAME INTO THIS WORLD TO REVEAL TO US THE WILL OF YOUR FATHER AND TO TEACH US THE WAY EVERLASTING. BEHOLD HOW YOUR SACRED WORD IS DENIED AND CORRUPTED IN THESE PERILOUS DAYS. HAVE MERCY UPON US, SAVE US FROM THE SNARES OF UNBELIEF AND THE SEDUCTIVE TEACHINGS OF THE WORLD, AND GRANT US TO ABIDE IN YOUR WORD THAT, MADE FREE FROM ERROR AND SIN, WE BE FOUND YOUR DISCIPLES INDEED. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 12 LIE 12TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER. IT LAMENTS OVER THE TEACHERS WHO ARE ALWAYS INVENTING NEW LITTLE DIS COVERIES AND FILLING UP GODS KINGDOM EVERYWHERE WITH THESE NEW SERVICES TO GOD. FOR WHERE HUMAN DOCTRINE ONCE GOES IN, THERE IS NO STOP OR END TO IT THEY INCREASE MORE AND MORE. THESE NEW INVENTIONS LOAD DOWN THE POOR CONSCIENCE BEYOND ALL LIMI T AND WORK SO THAT FEW TRUE SAINTS MAY REMAIN. AGAINST ALL THIS, THE PSALM COMFORTS US THAT GOD WILL AWAKEN HIS SALVATION, THAT IS. HIS WORD, WHICH CONFIDENTLY STORMS AGAINST THIS WORK OF STRAW. HE WILL FREE THE IMPRIS ONED CONSCIENCE. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN, HOWEVER, WITHOUT CROSS AND AGONY. AS SILVER IS PURIFIED IN THE FIRE, SO THE SAINTS ALSO MUST SUFFER IN THE MEANTIME, AND BY THIS MEANS BECOME EVER MORE PURE AND PERCEIVE THE TRUTH SO MUCH MORE CLEAR LY. THIS PSALM BELONGS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD COMMANDMENTS AND THE FIRST AND SECOND PETITIONS. K2  SAVE, O LORD, FOR THE GODLY I ONE IS GONE FOR THE FAITHFUL HAVE VANISHED FROM AMONG THE CHIL-1 DREN OF MAN. 2 EVERYONE UTTERS LIES TO HIS I NEIGHBOR WITH FLATTERING LIPS AND A DOUBLE I HEART THEY SPEAK. 3 MAY THE LORD CUT OFF ALL I FLATTERING LIPS, THE TONGUE THAT I MAKES GREAT BOASTS, 4 THOSE WHO SAY, WITH OUR TONGUE WE I WILL PREVAIL, OUR LIPS ARE WITH US WHO IS MASTER I OVER US? 5 BECAUSE THE POOR ARE PLUNDERED, BECAUSE THE NEEDY GROAN, I WILL NOW ARISE, I SAYS THE LORD I WILL PLACE HIM IN THE SAFETY FOR I WHICH HE LONGS " PSALM 13 6 THE WORDS OF THE LORD ARE I PURE WORDS.  LIKE SILVER REFINED IN A FURNACE ON THE GROUND. PURIFIED I SEVEN TIMES. 7 YOU, O LORD, WILL I KEEP THEM YOU WILL GUARD US FROM THIS GENERATION FOR- I EVER. 8 ON EVERY SIDE THE I WICKED PROWL. AS VILENESS IS EXALTED AMONG THE CHIL- I DREN OF MAN. PRAYER O LORD, OUR GOD, THE LORD OF HOSTS, GUARD US THAT WE ERR NOT FROM THE WAY OF TRUTH, AND KEEP US FROM THE TEMPTATION TO SIT WHERE THE MOCKERS SIT. PRESERVE US IN THE FAITH OF YOUR SON, AND A WALK OF GODLINESS ALL THE DAYS OF OUR PILGRIMAGE. BE WITH US WHEN WE MUST WALK AMONG THE WICKED, SUR ROUNDED BY SO MANY EVIL EXAMPLES, AND KEEP US FROM THE EVIL. AMEN.  PSALM 13 CJS C 13TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER AGAINST THE SORROW OR SADNESS OF THE SPIRIT THAT COMES AT TIMES FROM THE DEVIL HIMSELF, OR AT TIMES FROM THOSE WHO ACT AGAINST US WITH SPITE AND EVIL TRICKS. AS A RESULT, WE ARE CAST DOWN AND GRIEVE WHEN WE SEE SUCH EVIL ALIGNED AGAINST US. BUT PRAYER IS STRONGER THAN ALL MISFORTUNE. THIS PSALM GIVES US AN EXAMPLE BY WHICH WE CERTAINLY MAY BE COMFORTED AND LEARN IN EVERY KIND OF CALAMITY NOT TO BECOME ANXIOUS OR DOWN CAST, NOR LET THESE TROUBLES EAT AT OUR HEARTS. INSTEAD, WE LEARN TO TURN TO PRAYER, CRYING TO GOD ABOUT ALL OF THESE THINGS. WE KNOW THAT WE WILL BE HEARD AND FINALLY BE DELIV ERED. AS JAMES 5:13 ALSO SAYS: IS ANYONE AMONG YOU SUFFER- READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER ING? LET HIM PRAY. THIS PSALM BELONGS IN THE SECOND COMMANDMENT AND THE FIRST AND LAST PETITIONS, THAT WE MAY BE DELIVERED FROM EVIL. S3 1 HOW LONG, O LORD? WILL YOU FORGET ME FOR-1 EVER? HOW LONG WILL YOU HIDE YOUR I FACE FROM ME? 2 HOW LONG MUST I TAKE COUNSEL IN MY SOUL AND HAVE SORROW IN MY HEART I ALL THE DAY? HOW LONG SHALL MY ENEMY BE EXALTED I OVER ME? 3 CONSIDER AND ANSWER ME, OI LORD MY GOD LIGHT UP MY EYES, LEST L SLEEP THE I SLEEP OF DEATH, 4 LEST MY ENEMY SAY, I HAVE PREVAILED I OVER HIM, LEST MY FOES REJOICE BECAUSE 1 AM I SHAKEN. 5 BUT 1 HAVE TRUSTED IN YOUR I STEADFAST LOVE MY HEART SHALL REJOICE IN YOUR SAL-1 VATION. 6 1 WILL SING I TO THE LORD, BECAUSE HE HAS DEALT BOUNTIFULLY I WITH ME. PRAYER LORD JESUS, WHO BY YOUR INCARNATION WAS A MAN OF SORROWS AND ACQUAINTED WITH GRIEF, GRACIOUSLY REMEMBER US WHO ARE YET WALKING IN THIS VALE OF TEARS AND WHO MUST ENTER YOUR KINGDOM THROUGH MANY TRIBULATIONS. AS YOU HAVE PROMISED TO BE WITH YOUR OWN AND TO SUPPORT THEM TO THE END, GRANT US YOUR HOLY SPIRIT, THE SPIRIT OF JOY AND OF PEACE, TO COMFORT OUR HEARTS AND THE HEARTS OF ALL YOUR AFFLICTED CHRISTIANS WITH YOUR EVERLASTING COMFORT. AMEN. PSALM 14 OT PSALM 14 R |T 14IH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PROPHECY AND INSTRUC TION THAT TEACHES US THAT HUMAN DOCTRINE AND A LIFE WITHOUT FAITH IS NOTHING HUT AN ABOMINATION BEFORE GOD IF SUCH IS WORSHIP, IT IS ONLY BELLY WORSHIP BY WHICH THE UNGODLY FAT TEN THEMSELVES, DEVOURING THE GOOD OF THE PEOPLE. THEY DO NOT KNOW OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING OF THE TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD. THOUGH THEY LEACH AND PRAISE THE LAW OF GOD MOREOVER, THEY PROFANE AND BLASPHEME GOD'S WORD WHEN EVER IT REBUKES THEM AT ALL. THEY WILL LISTEN TO NOTHING ABOUT TRUST OR FAITH IN GOD. THESE PEOPLE MUST BE RESISTED BY PRAYER THIS PRAYER SHALL BE HEARD, AS THE LAST VERSE SAYS, AND THE GOSPEL OF CHNSL SHALL COME. THUS THIS PSALM REPROVES ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO TORMENTED THE PEOPLE WITH THE LAW. WHEN IT SPEAKS OF THE HELP FOR ZION, IT IS PROMISING OR PROPHESYING OF THE COMING OF CHNSL. FOR THE GOSPEL AND THE SPINT HAVE COME FROM ZION. THIS PSALM BELONGS TO THE FIRST AND THE THIRD COM MANDMENTS BECAUSE IT PRAISES GODS WORD, PROMISES CHNST, AND ALSO REPROVES THE HYPOCNTES AND DEVOUNNG TEACHERS OR BELLY-TEACHERS. IT IS IN THE FIRST AND SECOND PETITIONS, IN WHICH WE PRAY FOR HIS NAME AND HIS KINGDOM 1 THE FOOL SAYS IN HIS HEART. THERE I IS NO GOD. THEY ARE CORRUPT, THEY DO ABOMINABLE DEEDS, THERE IS NONE I WHO DOES GOOD. 2 THE LORD LOOKS DOWN FROM HEAVEN ON THE CHIL-1 DREN OF MAN. TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY WHO UNDERSTAND, WHO SEEK I AFTER GOD. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER S THEY HAVE ALL TURNED ASIDE TOGETHER THEY HAVE BE I COME CORRUPT" THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, NOT I EVEN ONE  HAVE THEY NO KNOWLEDGE, ALL THE EVIL- L DOERS WHO EAT UP MY PEOPLE AS THEY EAT BREAD AND DO NOT CALL UP- I ON THE LORD? 5 THERE THEY ARE IN GREAT 1 TERROR| FOR GOD IS WITH THE GENERATION OF THE I RIGHTEOUS.  YOU WOULD SHAME THE PLANS I OF THE POOR| BUT THE LORD IS HIS I REFUGE. 7 OH, THAT SALVATION FOR ISRAEL WOULD COME OUT OF I ZION! WHEN THE LORD RESTORES THE FORTUNES OF HIS PEOPLE, LET JACOB REJOICE, LET ISRAEL I BE GLAD. PRAYER LORD, FROM YOUR THRONE ON HIGH LOOK WITH A PITYING EYE UPON US POOR, SINFUL MORTALS. PRESERVE US, THAT WE NOT BE LED ASTRAY BY INFIDELITY OR SUPERSTITION, AND GRANT US SIMPLICITY OF FAITH TO RECEIVE THE GOSPEL OF YOUR SON, WHO HAS THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE, THAT IN HIM WE MAY BE YOURS IN TIME AND ETER NITY. AMEN. PSALM 15 TIE 15TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION THAT TEACH ES THE TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW, THE TRULY GOOD LIFE, AND TRUE GOOD WORKS. THESE ARE ALL FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT AND OF FAITH: TO LIVE BLAMELESS BEFORE GOD THROUGH TRUE FAITH, TO DO RIGHT TO THE NEIGHBOR, AND TO TURN AWAY FROM THE EVIL WAYS AND FROM THE HYPOCRISY OF THE UNGODLY, BY WHICH THEY SERVE PSALM 15 GOD WITH FRAUDULENT WORKS AND OMIT THE TRUE WORKS. THIS PSALM BELONGS TO THE THIRD COMMANDMENT, CONCERNING THE SABBATH, IN WHICH WE ARE TO HEAR AND LEARN GOD'S WORD, AND IT IS IN THE THIRD PETITION. 1 O LORD, WHO SHALL SOJOURN I IN YOUR TENT? WHO SHALL DWELL ON YOUR I HOLY HILL? 2 HE WHO WALKS BLAMELESSLY AND DOES I WHAT IS RIGHT AND SPEAKS TRUTH I IN HIS HEART 3 WHO DOES NOT SLANDER WITH HIS LONGUE AND DOES NO EVIL TO HIS I NEIGHBOR.' NOR LAKES UP A REPROACH A- I GAINST HIS FNEND. 4 IN WHOSE EYES A VILE PERSON IS DESPISED, BUT WHO HONORS THOSE WHO I TEAR THE LORD WHO SWEARS TO HIS OWN HURT AND I DOES NOT CHANGE 5 WHO DOES NOT PUT OUT HIS MONEY AT INTEREST AND DOES NOT TAKE A BRIBE AGAINST THE I INNOCENT HE WHO DOES THESE THINGS SHALL NEV- I ER BE MOVED PR A YB.R O LORD, OUR GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL FATHER, GRANT US STEAD FASTLY TO BELIEVE IN YOUR SON, JESUS CHRIST, OUR SAVIOR TO FEARLESSLY CONFESS HIM BEFORE MEN TO THE REPROVING OF THE UNBELIEVING AND THE WICKED. STRENGTHEN US BY YOUR SPIRIT TO WALK HONESTLY AS IN THE LIGHT OF DAY, BOTH PRIVATELY AND IN PUBLIC. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER OR PSALM 16 R 16TH PSALM IS A PROPHECY OF THE SUFFERING AND RESURRECTION OF CHRIST, AS THE APOSTLES THEMSELVES POWERFUL LY INDICATE (ACTS 2:25 AND 13:35). IT CLEARLY GIVES WITNESS THAT CHRIST HAS DISCARDED AS IDOLATRY THE OLD LAW WITH ITS SACRIFICES AND WORSHIP, AND HAS CHOSEN OTHER SAINTS AND ANOTHER PEOPLE TO BE HIS HEIRS. THIS PSALM BELONGS TO THE FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD COMMANDMENTS, FOR IT ANNOUNCES THE NEW PRAISE, WORK. WORD, AND WORSHIP THAT WOULD COME INTO THE WORLD IN CHRIST, AND THE PASSING OF THE OLD WORSHIP. IT IS IN THE FIRST AND SECOND PETITIONS. 1 PRESERVE ME, 1 O GOD FOR IN YOU I TAKE 1 REFUGE. 2 1 SAY TO THE LORD, YOU I ARE MY LORD I HAVE NO GOOD A-1 PART FROM YOU. 3 AS FOR THE SAINTS I IN THE LAND, THEY ARE THE EXCELLENT ONES, IN WHOM IS ALL I MY DELIGHT. 4 THE SORROWS OF THOSE WHO RUN AFTER ANOTHER GOD SHALL I MULTIPLY THEIR DRINK OFFERINGS OF BLOOD I WILL NOT POUR OUT OR TAKE THEIR NAMES I ON MY LIPS. 5 THE LORD IS MY CHOSEN PORTION I AND MY CUP YOU I HOLD MY LOT. 6 THE LINES HAVE FALLEN FOR ME IN PLEASANT I PLACES INDEED, I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL IN-1 HERITANCE. 7 1 BLESS THE LORD WHO GIVES ME I COUNSEL IN THE NIGHT ALSO MY HEART IN-1 STRUCTS ME. PSALM 17 8 1 HAVE SET THE LORD ALWAYS BE-1 FORE ME BECAUSE HE IS AT MY RIGHT HAND, I SHALL NOT BE I SHAKEN. 9 THEREFORE MY HEART IS GLAD, AND MY WHOLE BEING RE-1 JOICES MY FLESH ALSO I DWELLS SECURE. 10 FOR YOU WILL NOT ABANDON MY SOUL I TO SHEOL  OR LET YOUR HOLY ONE SEE COR-1 RUPTION. 11 YOU MAKE KNOWN TO ME THE I PATH OF LIFE IN YOUR PRESENCE THERE IS FULLNESS OF JOY AT YOUR RIGHT HAND ARE PLEASURES FOR-1 EVERMORE. PRAYER THANKS BE UNTO YOU, LORD JESUS, FOR YOUR BITTER SUFFER INGS, YOUR SHAMEFUL DEATH, AND YOUR JOYOUS RESURRECTION. ENLIGHTEN OUR EYES TO SEE IN YOU THE WAY UNTO LIFE. UPHOLD US BY YOUR TRUTH, SO WE MAY NOT FALL INTO IDOLATRY AND FALSE WORSHIP, AND PRESERVE US IN THE TRUE FAITH UNTO ETERNAL LIFE. AMEN. PSALM 17 C-|HE 17TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER. IT LAMENTS OVER THE FALSE TEACHERS AND THE SCRUPULOUS SAINTS WHO, BY HUMAN DOCTRINES AND WORKS, LEAD PEOPLE AWAY FROM GOD'S WORD. THEY PERSECUTE THE TRUE DOCTRINE AND HATE THE CROSS OF CHRIST. WITH THEIR DOCTRINES AND WORKS, THEY SEEK ONLY THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE GOOD THINGS, PRAISE, AND FREEDOM HERE ON EARTH, AND THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE TO SUFFER WANT. IT BELOOGS TO THE SECOND AND THIRD COMMANDMENTS AND IN THE FIRST PETITION, THAT GODS WORD AND NAME MAY BE SANCTIFIED. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER |7 1 HEAR A JUST CAUSE, O LORD ATTEND I TO MY CRY!" GIVE EAR TO MY PRAYER FROM LIPS FREE I OF DECEIT! 2 FROM YOUR PRESENCE LET MY VINDI- ! CATION COME! LET YOUR EYES BE- I HOLD THE RIGHT!

N THEY HAVE NOW SURROUNDED I OUR STEPS THEY SET THEIR EYES TO CAST US I TO THE GROUND. 12 HE IS LIKE A LION EA- I GER TO TEAR, AS A YOUNG LION LURKING IN I AMBUSH. 11 ARISE, IO LORD! CONFRONT HIM, SUB- I DUE HIM! PSALM 18 DELIVER MY SOUL FROM THE WICKED BY YOUR SWORD. FROM MEN BY YOUR HAND, L O LORD, FROM MEN OF THE WORLD WHOSE PORTION IS I IN THIS LIFE.

PRAYER LORD JESUS, TRUE SHEPHERD AND DEFENDER OF YOUR PEOPLE, GRANT US WISDOM, STRENGTH, AND PATIENCEWISDOM TO KNOW AND TO WALK IN THE WAY EVERLASTING STRENGTH TO RESIST ALL TEMPTATIONS OF ERROR AND SIN, AND TO BOLDLY CONFESS YOUR TRUTH BEFORE MEN PATIENCE TO BEAR THE CROSS WITHOUT MURMURING, AND GLADLY TO SUFFER WITH YOU THAT WE MA ALSO RULE WITH YOU AMEN.  PSALM IS R X NE 18TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS IN WHICH, AS THE TITLE DECLARES. DAVID THANKS GOD THAT HE HAS DELIVERED HIM FROM ALL HIS ENEMIES, SUCH AS SAUL, THE HEATHEN. ABSALOM, AND THE REBELLIOUS ISRAELITES. DAVID RELATES THAT HE WAS IN DEADLY DISTRESSES AND THAT GOD HAD HELPED HIM OUT OF THEM. IN THE MANNER OF A PROPHET HE SHOWS HOW GOD HELPED HIM AS GOD HAD HELPED ISRAEL IN EGYPT. HE PRAISES GOD. WHO HELD BACK HIS ENEMIES, AND THANKS GOD FOR HIS HELP AGAINST THE DISOBEDIENT AND THE REBELS, SUCH AS WERE SEBA AND MOST OF ISRAEL (2 SAMUEL 20). DAVID HAD SO MANY ENE MIES AND HOSTILE SUBJECTS, THAT EVEN THE HEATHEN FOREIGNERS READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER (HE SAYS HERE) WERE MORE OBEDIENT THAT HIS OWN PEOPLE. CONSEQUENTLY, EVERYONE NEEDS TO KEEP THIS PSALM AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE SHOULD THANK GOD FOR HIS HELP WHEN HE DELIVERS US OUT OF OUR TROUBLES. WHOEVER WANTS TO EXPLAIN THIS PSALM SPIRITUALLY MAY THINK OF DAVID AS A CHRISTIAN, STANDING AGAINST THE HEATHENS, THE TYRANTS, THE HERETICS, AND THE FALSE CHRISTIANS. FROM ALL OF THESE, CHRIST AND ALL HIS PEOPLE WILL FINALLY BE DELIVERED. PSALM 18 BELONGS IN THE SECOND COMMANDMENT AND IN THE FIRST PETITION, BECAUSE IT THANKS GOD AND PRAISES HIS HOLY NAME. A9 1 1 I LOVE YOU,  O I LORD, MY STRENGTH. 2 THE LORD IS MY ROCK AND MY FORTRESS AND MY DE- I LIVERER,  MY GOD, MY ROCK, IN WHOM I TAKE REFUGE, MY SHIELD, AND THE HORN OF MY SALVATION, MY I STRONGHOLD. 3 1 CALL UPON THE LORD, WHO IS WORTHY I TO BE PRAISED,  AND I AM SAVED FROM MY I ENEMIES. 4 THE CORDS OF DEATH EN- I COMPASSED ME  THE TORRENTS OF DESTRUCTION AS- I SAILED ME 5 THE CORDS OF SHEOL EN- I TANGLED ME THE SNARES OF DEATH CON- I FRONTED ME. 6 IN MY DISTRESS I CALLED UPON THE LORD TO MY GOD I I CRIED FOR HELP.  FROM HIS TEMPLE HE HEARD MY VOICE, AND MY CRY TO HIM I REACHED HIS EARS. 7 THEN THE EARTH I REELED AND ROCKED THE FOUNDATIONS ALSO OF THE MOUNTAINS TREMBLED AND QUAKED, BECAUSE HE WAS I ANGRY. 8 SMOKE WENT UP FROM HIS NOSTRILS, AND DEVOURING FIRE I FROM HIS MOUTH  GLOWING COALS FLAMED I FORTH FROM HIM. 46 PSALM 18 9 HE BOWED THE HEAVENS AND I CAME DOWN THICK DARKNESS WAS UN- I DER HIS FEET. 10 HE RODE ON A CHER- I UB AND FLEW HE CAME SWIFTLY ON THE WINGS I OF THE WIND. 1 1 HE MADE DARKNESS HIS COVERING, HIS CANOPY A- I ROUND HIM,  THICK CLOUDS DARK WITH I WATER. 12 OUT OF THE BNGHTNESS BE- I FORE HIM HAILSTONES AND COALS OF FIRE BROKE I THROUGH HIS CLOUDS. 13 THE LORD ALSO THUNDERED IN THE 1 HEAVENS. AND THE MOST HIGH UTTERED HIS VOICE, HAILSTONES AND I COALS OF FIRE. 14 AND HE SENT OUT HIS ARROWS AND I SCATTERED THEM HE FLASHED FORTH LIGHTNINGS AND I ROUTED THEM. 15 THEN THE CHANNELS OF THE SEA WERE SEEN. AND THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE WORLD WERE 1 LAID BARE  AT YOUR REBUKE. O LORD, AT THE BLAST OF THE BREATH OF YOUR I NOSTRILS. 16 HE SENT FROM ON HIGH, HE I TOOK ME HE DREW ME OUT OF MANY I WATERS. 17 HE RESCUED ME FROM MY STRONG I ENEMY  AND FROM THOSE WHO HATED ME. FOR THEY WERE LOO MIGHT- I Y FOR ME. 10 THEY CONFRONTED ME IN THE DAY OF MY CA- I LAMITY, BUT THE LORD WAS I MY SUPPORT. 19 HE BROUGHT ME OUT INTO A I BROAD PLACE HE RESCUED ME. BECAUSE HE DELIGHT- I ED IN ME. 20 THE LORD DEALT WITH ME ACCORDING TO MY I RIGHTEOUSNESS ACCORDING TO THE CLEANNESS OF MY HANDS HE RE- I WARDED ME. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 21 FOR I HAVE KEPT THE WAYS I OF THE LORD, AND HAVE NOT WICKEDLY DEPARTED I FROM MY GOD. 22 FOR ALL HIS JUST DECREES WERE BE-1 FORE ME, AND HIS STATUTES I DID NOT PUT A-1 WAY FROM ME. 23 1 WAS BLAMELESS BE-1 FORE HIM, AND I KEPT MYSELF I FROM MY GUILT. 24 SO THE LORD HAS REWARDED ME ACCORDING TO MY I RIGHTEOUSNESS, ACCORDING TO THE CLEANNESS OF MY HANDS I IN HIS SIGHT. PRAYER PRAISE, HONOR, AND THANKSGIVING DO WE OFFER UNTO YOU, O FATHER OF LIGHTS, FROM WHOM COMES EVERY GOOD AND EVERY PERFECT GIFT, BECAUSE YOU DAILY PRESERVE US FROM MANY EVILS, GUARD US IN MANY DANGERS, CROWN US WITH MANY BLESSINGS, ENABLE OUR HEARTS TO APPRECIATE YOUR GOODNESS, AND TO REJOICE BEFORE YOU, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST, OUR SAVIOR. AMEN. 25 WITH THE MERCIFUL YOU SHOW YOURSELF I MERCIFUL WITH THE BLAMELESS MAN YOU SHOW YOURSELF I BLAMELESS 26 WITH THE PURIFIED YOU SHOW YOUR-1 SELF PURE AND WITH THE CROOKED YOU MAKE YOURSELF SEEM I TORTUOUS. 27 FOR YOU SAVE A HUMBLE I PEOPLE, BUT THE HAUGHTY EYES I YOU BRING DOWN. 2I FOR IT IS YOU WHO I LIGHT MY LAMP THE LORD MY GOD LIGHTENS MY I DARKNESS. 29 FOR BY YOU I CAN RUN A-1 GAINST A TROOP, AND BY MY GOD I CAN LEAP O I VER A WALL. 30 THIS GODHIS WAY IS I PERFECT THE WORD OF THE LORD PROVES TRUE HE IS A SHIELD FOR ALL THOSE WHO TAKE REF- 1 UGE IN HIM. PSALM 18 FOR WHO IS GOD, I BUT THE LORD?"

THIS PSALM ACCUSES THE FALSE SAINTS OF WILLINGLY ACCEPTING BRIBES. FOR SUCH SAINTS ARE CERTAINLY PURE SERVANTS OF GREED, WHOSE GOD IS THEIR STOM ACH, AS ST. PAUL SAYS (PHILIPPIANS 3:19). BUT WITH ALL THEIR SPIRITUAL HYPOCRISY AND THEIR WORLDLY GLORY, THEY ARE DESTRUC TIVE SAINTS. THEREFORE, IT IS GOOD TO PRAY THAT THEY MAY NOT DECEIVE US.

HE GIVES THE NAME OF DESERTS, FORESTS, AND DEER TO THE LANDS OF THE EARTH THAT WERE UNDER JEW OR GENTILE AND THAT HAVE BEEN OPENED AND CONVERTED TO THE GOSPEL. THIS PSALM BELONGS IN THE THIRD COMMANDMENT AND IN THE SECOND PETITION. PSALM 29 9 1 ASCRIBE TO THE LORD, O HEAVENLY I BEINGS," ASCNBE TO THE LORD GLO-1 RY AND STRENGTH. 2 ASCRIBE TO THE LORD THE GLORY I DUE HIS NAME WORSHIP THE LORD IN THE SPLENDOR OF I HOLINESS.  THE VOICE OF THE LORD IS OVER THE I WATERS THE GOD OF GLORY THUNDERS, THE LORD. OVER MANY I WATERS. 4 THE VOICE OF THE LORD IS I POWERFUL THE VOICE OF THE LORD IS FULL OF I MAJESTY. 5 THE VOICE OF THE LORD BREAKS THE I CEDARS THE LORD BREAKS THE CEDARS OF I LEBANON. T HE MAKES LEBANON TO SKIP I LIKE A CALF, AND SINON LIKE A YOUNG I WILD OX. 7 THE VOICE 1 OF THE LORD FLASHES FORTH I FLAMES OF FIRE. 8 THE VOICE OF THE LORD SHAKES THE I WILDERNESS THE LORD SHAKES THE WILDERNESS I OF KADESH. 9 THE VOICE OF THE LORD MAKES THE DEER GIVE BIRTH AND STRIPS THE I FORESTS BARE, AND IN HIS TEMPLE ALL CRY, I GLORY!" O THE LORD SITS ENTHRONED O- I VER THE FLOOD THE LORD SITS ENTHRONED AS KING FOR-1 EVER. O MAY THE LORD GIVE STRENGTH TO HIS I PEOPLE! MAY THE LORD BLESS HIS PEOPLE I WITH PEACE! PRAYER THANKS AND PRAISE BE UNTO YOU. OUR GOD AND LORD, FOR SENDING US THE GOSPEL OF YOUR SON. JESUS CHRIST, IN WHICH YOU LEACH US THE WAY OF SALVATION AND COMFORT US WITH THE HOPE OF EVERLASTING LIFE. MAKE YOUR WORD IN US A POWER OF SALVATION, AND THE ANCHOR OF OUR SOULS IN LIFE AND DEATH. CAUSE ALSO THE VOICE OF YOUR WORD TO BE SOUNDED ABROAD, THAT THE NATIONS THAT DO NOT KNOW YOU MAY COME TO YOUR LIGHT. AMEN. 7 | READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 30 30TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS IN WHICH THE PSALMIST GIVES THANKS THAT GOD HAS REDEEMED HIM FROM THE HIGH SPIRITUAL AFFLICTIONS OF THE DEVIL, WHICH ARE SADNESS, DEPRESSION, TERROR, DESPAIR, DOUBT, THE PERILS OF DEATH, AND SIMILAR POISONOUS, FIERY DARTS OF THE DEVIL. NEVERTHELESS, THE PSALMIST KNOWS HE HAS THE COMFORT THAT GOD IS ONLY ANGRY FOR THE BLINK OF AN EYE AND NEITHER DESIRES NOR WILLS OUR DEATH OR DISTRESS BUT DESIRES RATHER TO SEE US LIVE AND BE JOY FUL. THIS PSALM BELONGS IN THE SECOND COMMANDMENT AND IN THE FIRST PETITION. SO 1 1 WILL EXTOL YOU, O LORD, FOR YOU HAVE I DRAWN ME UP AND HAVE NOT LET MY FOES REJOICE I OVER ME. 2 O LORD MY GOD, 1 CRIED TO I YOU FOR HELP, AND YOU HAVE I HEALED ME. 3 O LORD, YOU HAVE BROUGHT UP MY SOUL I FROM SHEOL YOU RESTORED ME TO LIFE FROM AMONG THOSE WHO GO DOWN I TO THE PIT. 4 SING PRAISES TO THE LORD, O I YOU HIS SAINTS, AND GIVE THANKS TO HIS I HOLY NAME. 5 FOR HIS ANGER IS BUT FOR A MOMENT, AND HIS FAVOR IS FOR A I LIFETIME. WEEPING MAY TARRY FOR THE NIGHT, BUT JOY COMES WITH THE I MORNING. 6 AS FOR ME, 1 SAID IN MY PROS- I PERITY,  1 SHALL NEV-  ER BE MOVED. 7 BY YOUR FAVOR, O LORD, YOU MADE MY MOUNTAIN I STAND STRONG YOU HID YOUR FACE 11 WAS DISMAYED. PSALM 30  TO YOU, O I LORD, I CRY, AND TO THE LORD 1 PLEAD FOR I MERCY:  WHAT PROFIT IS THERE IN MY DEATH, IF I GO DOWN I TO THE PIT? WILL THE DUST PRAISE YOU? WILL IT TELL OF YOUR I FAITHFULNESS ? 10 HEAR, O LORD, AND BE MERCI- I FUL TO ME!' O LORD, BE MY L HELPER!' N YOU HAVE TURNED FOR ME MY MOURNING INTO I DANCING" YOU HAVE LOOSED MY SACKCLOTH AND CLOTHED ME WITH I GLADNESS. '2 THAT MY GLORY MAY SING YOUR PRAISE AND NOT BE I SILENT.' O LORD MY GOD. 1 WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOU FOR- I EVER! PRAYER THANKS TO YOU, OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN, FOR THE COUNTLESS BLESSINGS YOU HAVE BESTOWED ON US FROM OUR CHILDHOOD DAYS. THANKS TO YOU BECAUSE YOU SO OFTEN HAVE BEEN OUR HELPER IN SPIRITUAL AND BODILY NEED. AS IN THE PAST, BE WITH US IN THE FUTURE TO GIVE US A JOYOUS HEART, TO UPHOLD US IN TRIALS, TO STRENGTHEN US IN TEMPTATIONS, AND TO COMFORT US BY YOUR HOLY SPIRIT THROUGH JESUS CHRIST, OUR SAVIOR. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER OR PS AIM 31 CHE 31ST PSALM IS A UNIVERSAL PSALM OF THANKS, A PSALM OF PRAYER, AND A PSALM OF COMFORT, ALL AT THE SAME TIME. IT IS SPOKEN IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST AND OF HIS SAINTS, WHO, ON ACCOUNT OF THE WORD OF GOD, ARE PLAGUED THEIR ENTIRE LIVESINWARDLY WITH FEARS AND TROUBLES OUTWARDLY WITH PERSECUTIONS, SLANDER, AND CONTEMPT. YET THEY ARE COM FORTED AND DELIVERED BY GOD OUT OF ALL OF THEM. THIS PSALM BELONGS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD COMMANDMENTS AND IN THE FIRST AND SECOND PETITIONS. 3 | ' IN YOU, O LORD, DO I TAKE REFUGE LET ME NEVER BE I PUT TO SHAME IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS DE-1 LIVER ME! 2 INCLINE YOUR EAR TO ME RESCUE ME I SPEEDILY! BE A ROCK OF REFUGE FOR ME, A STRONG FORTRESS TO I SAVE ME! 1 FOR YOU ARE MY ROCK AND MY I FORTRESS AND FOR YOUR NAME'S SAKE YOU LEAD ME AND I GUIDE ME 4 YOU TAKE ME OUT OF THE NET THEY HAVE HIDDEN I FOR ME, FOR YOU ARE MY I REFUGE.

PSALM 31 9 BE GRACIOUS TO ME, 0 LORD, FOR 1 AM I IN DISTRESS MY EYE IS WASTED FROM GRIEF MY SOUL AND MY BODY I ALSO. 10 FOR MY LIFE IS SPENT WITH SORROW, AND MY YEARS WITH I SIGHING MY STRENGTH FAILS BECAUSE OF MY INIQUITY, AND MY BONES I WASTE AWAY.

AS THEY SCHEME TOGETHER AGAINST ME, AS THEY PLOT TO I TAKE MY LIFE. PRAYER LORD JESUS, WE THANK YOU FOR TAKING FROM US THAT HEAVY LOAD OF OUR SINS WHICH WE COULD NOT BEAR, BUT WHICH YOU BORE IN YOUR OWN BODY ON THE TREE, RANSOMING US FROM ETERNAL DEATH. GRANT US PATIENCE AND RESIGNATION IN SUFFERING WITH YOU, THAT WE MAY WILLINGLY TAKE UP OUR CROSS DAILY AND FOL LOW YOU THROUGH SUFFERING TO GLORY. AMEN. 14 BUT 1 TRUST IN YOU, I O LORD I SAY, YOU I ARE MY GOD. 15 MY TIMES ARE I IN YOUR HAND RESCUE ME FROM THE HAND OF MY ENEMIES AND FROM MY PERSE-1 CUTORS! 16 MAKE YOUR FACE SHINE ON YOUR I SERVANT SAVE ME IN YOUR I STEADFAST LOVE! 17 O LORD, LET ME NOT BE PUT TO SHAME, FOR I CALL UP-1 ON YOU READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER LET THE WICKED BE PUT TO SHAME LET THEM GO SILENTLY I TO SHEOL. 18 LET THE LYING I LIPS BE MUTE, : WHICH SPEAK INSOLENTLY AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUS IN PRIDE I AND CONTEMPT. 19 OH, HOW ABUNDANT IS YOUR GOODNESS, WHICH YOU HAVE STORED UP FOR THOSE WHO I FEAR YOU AND WORKED FOR THOSE WHO TAKE REFUGE IN YOU, IN THE SIGHT OF THE CHILDREN OF I MANKIND! 20 IN THE COVER OF YOUR PRESENCE YOU HIDE THEM FROM THE L PLOTS OF MEN YOU STORE THEM IN YOUR SHELTER FROM THE I STRIFE OF TONGUES. 21 BLESSED I BE THE LORD, FOR HE HAS WONDROUSLY SHOWN HIS STEADFAST LOVE TO ME WHEN I WAS IN A BESIEGED I CITY. 22 1 HAD SAID IN MY ALARM, I AM CUT OFF I FROM YOUR SIGHT." BUT YOU HEARD THE VOICE OF MY PLEAS FOR MERCY WHEN I CRIED TO I YOU FOR HELP. 23 LOVE THE LORD, ALL I YOU HIS SAINTS!  THE LORD PRESERVES THE FAITHFUL BUT ABUNDANTLY REPAYS THE ONE WHO I ACTS IN PRIDE. 24 BE STRONG, AND LET YOUR HEART TAKE I COURAGE, ALL YOU WHO WAIT I FOR THE LORD! PRAYER LORD JESUS, WHO SUFFERED MEN TO SLANDER YOU AND TO BEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST YOU, YET DID NOT OPEN YOUR MOUTH SAVE ONLY TO PRAY FOR YOUR TORMENTORS, SHED ABROAD YOUR LOVE IN OUR HEARTS THAT WE HATE NOT THEM THAT HATE US AND SPEAK EVIL AGAINST US, BUT ENABLE US TO LOVE OUR ENEMIES, BEING ALWAYS READY TO SUFFER WRONG FOR YOUR NAMES SAKE. AMEN. 76 PSALM 31 I S AT THIS POINT WE WILL STOP POINTING OUT IN WHICH COM MANDMENT AND WHICH PETITION EACH INDIVIDUAL PSALM BELONGS. IN THE PRECEDING, WE HAVE EXAMPLES ENOUGH FROM WHICH IT MAY BE EASILY DETERMINED WHERE EACH OF THE FOL LOWING PSALMS BELONG. PSALMS OF PRAYER BELONG IN THE SECOND COMMANDMENT AND THE FIRST PETITION, FOR THEY PRAISE GODS NAME AND CALL ON HIM. PSALMS OF INSTRUCTION, PSALMS OF COMFORT, AND PSALMS OF THANKS ALL BELONG IN THE THIRD COMMANDMENT AS WELL AS THE SECOND AND IN THE FIRST AND SECOND PETITIONS. FOR THEY HALLOW THE TRUE SABBATH WITH TRUE WORKS AND WITH TRUE WORSHIP AND MANY PSALMS OFTEN BELONG IN ALL THREE COMMANDMENTS AND PETITIONS. WE HAVE POINTED THESE OUT SO THAT WE MIGHT LEARN WELL TO USE AND UNDERSTAND THE COMMANDS OF GOD AND THE LORD'S PRAYER. WE SEE THAT THE BELOVED SAINTS AND PROPHETS SPOKE OF AND DEVOTED THEMSELVES SO ABUNDANTLY AND IN SUCH DIVERSE WAYS TO THE FIRST THREE COMMANDMENTS AND PETITIONS. THEY ALWAYS TREATED THEM ANEW AND AFRESH, YET WITHOUT HAVING SOMETHING NEW TO LEACH, NOR DID THEY GO BEYOND THE TABLES OF MOSES AND THE LORDS PRAYER. FROM THIS WE MAY UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THE SCRIPTURES AND THE HOLY LIVES OF THE PROPHETS PROCEEDED FROM THE COM MANDS OF GOD. THE PROPHETS LIVED IN THESE COMMANDS, AND UNLIKE THE FALSE SPIRITS AND TEACHERS OF HUMAN DOCTRINE, THEY BROUGHT OUT NO NEW LEACHING AT ALL. AGAINST THE NEW' TEACH INGS THEY CRY AND STRUGGLE THE HARDEST, SO THAT THE PEOPLE MIGHT REMAIN WITH THE COMMANDMENTS AND THE PURE AND CLEAR WORD OF GOD. AND SO THAT FALSE TEACHINGS AND OTHER ERRORS MIGHT ALWAYS BE PREVENTED. 77 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 32 R 32ND PSALM IS AN EXEMPLARY PSALM OF INSTRUC TION THAT LEACHES US WHAT SIN IS, AND HOW ONE MIGHT BE FREED FROM IT AND BE RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD. OUR REASON DOES NOT KNOW WHAT SIN IS AND TRIES TO MAKE SATISFACTION FOR IT WITH WORKS. BUT THE PSALMIST SAYS THAT EVEN SAINTS ARE SINNERS. THEY CANNOT BECOME HOLY OR BLESSED EXCEPT BY CONFESSING THEMSELVES AS SINNERS BEFORE GOD, KNOWING THAT THEY ARE REGARDED AS RIGHTEOUS ONLY FROM THE GRACE OF GOD, APART FROM ANY SERVICE OR WORK. IN SHORT, OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS CALLED (IN PLAIN LANGUAGE) THE FORGIVENESS OF OUR SINS. OR, AS IT SAYS HERE: SINS NOT COUNTED, SINS COVERED, SINS NOT TO BE SEEN  HERE STAND THE CLEAR PLAIN WORDS: ALL THE SAINTS ARE SINNERS AND REMAIN SINNERS. BUT THEY ARE HOLY BECAUSE GOD IN HIS GRACE NEITHER SEES NOR COUNTS THESE SINS, BUT FORGETS, FORGIVES, AND COVERS THEM. THERE IS THUS NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE SAINTS AND THE NON-SAINTS. THEY ARE SINNERS ALIKE AND ALL SIN DAILY, ONLY THAT THE SINS OF THE HOLY ARE NOT COUNTED BUT COVERED AND THE SINS OF THE UNHOLY ARE NOT COVERED BUT COUNTED. ONE WOULD HAVE A HEALING DRESSING ON AND IS BANDAGED THE OTHER WOUND IS OPEN AND UNDRESSED. NEVERTHELESS, BOTH OF THEM ARE TRULY WOUNDED, TRULY SINNERS, CONCERNING WHICH WE IN OUR BOOKS IN OTHER PLACES HAVE ABUNDANTLY BORE WITNESS. CSU? 1 BLESSED IS THE ONE WHOSE TRANSGRESSION IS FOR- I GIVEN. WHOSE SIN IS 1 COVERED. 2 BLESSED IS THE MAN AGAINST WHOM THE LORD COUNTS NO IN-1 IQUITY, AND IN WHOSE SPIRIT THERE IS I NO DECEIT. PSALM 32 I FOR WHEN 1 KEPI SILENT, MY BONES WAST- I ED AWAY THROUGH M GROANING I ALL DAY LONG 4 FOR DAY AND NIGHT YOUR HAND WAS HEAVY UP- I ON ME MY STRENGTH WAS DNED UP AS BY THE HEAT OF I SUMMER S 1 ACKNOW LEDGED MY SIN TO YOU, AND I DID NOT COVER MY IN- I LQUITY I SAID. I WILL CONFESS MY TRANSGRESSIONS TO THE LORD. AND YOU FORGAVE THE INIQUITY I OF MY SIN 6 THEREFORE LET EVERYONE WHO IS GODLY OFFER PRAYER TO YOU AT A TIME WHEN YOU L MAY BE FOUND: SURELY IN THE RUSH OF GREAT WATERS, THEY SHALL NOT I REACH HIM. 7 YOU ARE A HIDING PLACE FOR ME, YOU PRESERVE ME FROM I TROUBLE: YOU SURROUND ME WITH SHOUTS OF DE- I LIVE RANEE. 8 1 WILL INSTRUCT YOU AND TEACH YOU IN THE WAY I YOU SHOULD GO I WILL COUNSEL YOU WITH MY EYE UP- I ON YOU. 9 BE NOT LIKE A HORSE OR A MULE, WITHOUT UNDER- I STANDING. WHICH MUST BE CURBED WITH BIT AND BRIDLE, OR IT W ILL NOT STAY I NEAR YOU. ,0 MANY ARE THE SORROWS OF THE I WICKED. BUT STEADFAST LOVE SURROUNDS THE ONE WHO TRUSTS I IN THE LORD. N BE GLAD IN THE LORD, AND REJOICE. O I RIGHTEOUS. AND SHOUT FOR JOY, ALL YOU UP- I NGHT IN HEART! PRAYER O GOD. OUR HEAVENLY FATHER, WITH WHOM IS GRACE AND MUCH FORGIVENESS, BE MERCIFUL TO US WHO WERE BOM IN SIN AND CANNOT BUT SIN AND FALL SHORT EVERY DAY. FORGIVE US OUR MANY TRANSGRESSIONS AND ACCOUNT THEM AGAINST US NO MORE, BUT MAKE US YOUR HEIRS THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. YOUR BELOVED SON. WHO WAS DELIVERED INTO DEATH FOR OUR OFFENCES, AND WAS RAISED AGAIN FOR OUR JUSTIFICATION. AMEN. 79 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 33 HE 33RD PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS TO GOD IN GEN ERAL FOR HIS BLESSINGS, FOR HELPING HIS FAITHFUL PEOPLE IN ALL KINDS OF DISTRESS, AND FOR NOT LETTING THEM PERISH. HE IS ABLE TO HELP BECAUSE HE MADE ALL THINGS AND STILL CREATES ALL THINGS WITH A WORD, SO THAT NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH HIM. GOD IS ALSO SO GOOD AND TRUE THAT HE WILL HELP AND WILLING LY HELPS, AS HE HAS PROMISED IN THE FIRST COMMANDMENT: I WILL BE YOUR GOD, THAT IS, 1 WILL BE YOUR COMFORT, HELP, SAL VATION, LIFE, AND ALL GOOD THINGS, AND 1 WILL STAND AGAINST ANYTHING THAT WOULD DO YOU HARM. THATS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE GOD. BUT THE PSALMIST PARTICULARLY THANKS AND PRAISES THE MIGHTY BLESSING OF GOD, THAT HE GUIDES THE WHOLE WORLD, EVEN THE HEARTS, THOUGHTS, INTENTIONS, ANGER, AND FURY OF THE KINGS AND PRINCES, NOT AS THEY WILL, BUT AS HE WILLS. AND HE FINALLY FRUSTRATES ALL THEIR INTENTIONS, SO THAT THEY ACCOMPLISH NOTHING AS THEY REALLY WANT. WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUS HE IMMEDIATELY TURNS ASIDE AND OVERTHROWS. THIS IS THE PARTICULAR JOY AND COMFORT OF HIS SAINTS AGAINST THE ARROGANT AND OVERWEENING INSOLENCE, THE THRASHING AND THREATS OF THE RAGING NOBLES AND THE RUTHLESS TYRANTS, WHO SUPPOSE THAT THEY CAN WITH THREATS DEVOUR ALL THE SAINTS OF GOD AND HURL GOD HIMSELF DOWN FROM HEAVEN. BUT BEFORE THEY HAVE HALF BEGUN, THEY LIE IN THE DUST. CONSIDER THE PEO PLE OF SODOM AGAINST LOT, SENNACHERIB THE KING, AND OUR TYRANTS TODAYHOW TOTALLY COUNTLESS INTENTIONS HAVE BEEN DASHED UP TILL NOW. PSALM 33 33 1 SHORN FOR JOY IN THE LORD. O YOU  RIGHTEOUS' PRAISE BEFITS THE I UPRIGHT. 2 GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD I WITH THE LYRE MAKE MELODY TO HIM WITH THE HARP OF I TEN STRINGS! 3 SING TO HIM A NEW SONG PLAY SKILLFULLY ON THE STRINGS, WITH  LOUD SHOUTS. 4 FOR THE WORD OF THE LORD IS I UPRIGHT. AND ALL HIS WORK IS DONE IN I FAITHFULNESS. 5 HE LOVES RIGHTEOUSNESS AND ' JUSTICE THE EARTH IS FULL OF THE STEADFAST LOVE I OF THE LORD. 6 BY THE WORD OF THE LORD THE HEAV- I ENS WERE MADE. AND BY THE BREATH OF HIS MOUTH ! ALL THEIR HOST. 7 HE GATHERS THE WATERS OF THE SEA ! AS A HEAP HE PUTS THE DEEPS IN I STOREHOUSES. 8 LET ALL THE EARTH I FEAR THE LORD LET ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE WORLD STAND IN I AWE OF HIM! 9 FOR HE SPOKE, AND IT I CAME TO BE HE COMMANDED, AND IT I STOOD FIRM. ' THE LORD BRINGS THE COUNSEL OF THE NATIONS TO I NOTHING HE FRUSTRATES THE PLANS OF THE I PEOPLES. " THE COUNSEL OF THE LORD STANDS FOR- I EVER, THE PLANS OF HIS HEART TO ALL GENER- I ATIONS. 12 BLESSED IS THE NATION WHOSE GOD I IS THE LORD, THE PEOPLE WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN AS HIS I HERITAGE 1 13 THE LORD LOOKS DOWN FROM L HEAVEN HE SEES ALL THE CHIL- I DREN OF MAN 14 FROM WHERE HE SITS ENTHRONED HE I LOOKS OUR ON ALL THE INHABITANTS I OF THE EARTH. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 15 HE WHO FASHIONS THE HEARTS I OF THEM ALL AND OBSERVES I ALL THEIR DEEDS. 6 THE KING IS NOT SAVED BY HIS GREAT I ARMY A WARRIOR IS NOT DELIVERED BY HIS I GREAT STRENGTH. 17 THE WAR HORSE IS A FALSE HOPE FOR SAL-1 VATION, AND BY ITS GREAT MIGHT IT CANNOT I RESCUE. 11 BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD IS ON THOSE WHO I FEAR HIM, ON THOSE WHO HOPE IN HIS I STEADFAST LOVE, I THAT HE MAY DELIVER THEIR I SOUL FROM DEATH AND KEEP THEM ALIVE IN I FAMINE. 20 OUR SOUL WAITS I FOR THE LORD HE IS OUR HELP I AND OUR SHIELD. 21 FOR OUR HEART IS I GLAD IN HIM, BECAUSE WE TRUST IN HIS I HOLY NAME. 22 LET YOUR STEADFAST LOVE, O LORD, BE UP-1 ON US, EVEN AS WE I HOPE IN YOU. PRAYER WE THANK YOU, LORD, FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN US FROM THE DAYS OF OUR CHILDHOOD. CONTINUE TO MUL TIPLY YOUR MERCIES UPON US, KEEP US IN YOUR FEAR AND FAVOR, CAUSE US TO WALK IN YOUR PRAISE, PROTECT US FROM ALL ENEMIES, BOTH VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE, AND GRANT US, LIKE SIMEON OF OLD, TO DEPART IN PEACE, THROUGH CHRIST, OUR SAVIOR. AMEN. PSALM 34 PSALM 34 C |NE 34TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS, MUCH LIKE THE PRECEDING PSALM. IT OFFERS US THE HISTORY OF DAVID AS AN EXAMPLE FOR ALL THE RIGHTEOUS SO WE MIGHT LEARN FROM HIM THAT GOD NEVER DESPISES THE CRIES OF HIS SAINTS. MOREOVER, IT TEACHES US TO FEAR GOD AND NO ONE ELSE FURTHER, TO BE ON OUR GUARD AGAINST FALSE TEACHERS, AGAINST CURSES, GRUMBLINGS, AND SLANDER. WE SHOULD HAVE PATIENCE, BLESS ENEMIES RATHER THAN CURSE THEM, WISH THEM ALL GOOD, DO GOOD TO THEM RATHER THAN EVIL, AND SO (AS MUCH AS IN US LIES) TO LIVE AT PEACE WITH ALL PEOPLE, WHETHER THEY ARE EVIL OR GODLY. FOR IT IS CERTAIN (THE PSALMIST SAYS) THAT THE RIGHTEOUS WILL SUFFER MANY THINGS. IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE. IF YOU WILL BE RIGHTEOUS, YOU MUST TAKE UP YOUR CROSS AND SUFFER. THIS IS HOW IT MUST BE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE LORD WILL TRULY HELP US OUT OF ALL THESE AFFLICTIONS, THAT NONE OF THE LEAST OF YOUR BONES WILL BE TAKEN AWAY OR MISSING. YES, EVEN THE HAIRS OF THE HEAD ARE NUMBERED ALTHOUGH THE BONES OF THE SAINTS IN THEIR MARTYRDOM WERE OFTEN BROKEN, SOME OF THEM BURNT TO ASHES, AND MANY MORE DECAYING IN THEIR GRACES, THEY WILL YET RETURN AND NOT REMAIN ETERNALLY BROKEN OR BE CALLED BROKEN. RATHER, FOR A TIME THEY WILL BE BROKEN, BUT AFTERWARD THEY WILL ALL AGAIN BE MORE WHOLE AND HEALTHY THAN THEY FORMERLY WERE. THIS IS THE FIRST PSALM THAT SPEAKS ABOUT ANGELS, THAT THEY ATTEND TO THE RIGHTEOUS AND WAIT ON US. THEY ARE NOT SIMPLY WITH US OR AROUND US. THE ANGELS ARE LIKE AN ARMYARMED SOLDIERS ENCAMPED AROUND US. PITCHING THEIR TENTS, KEEPING WATCH, AND FIGHTING FOR US AGAINST THE DEVIL AND ALL HIS MIN IONS. THIS IS A GREAT AND EXCELLENT COMFORT FOR ALL WHO BELIEVE, AS THE PROPHET ELISHA, FOLLOWING THIS VERSE, MADE READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER CLEAR WITH HIS CLEAR AND CORRECT EXAMPLE (2 KINGS 6:17). BUT THIS VERSE IS TAKEN FROM GENESIS 32:1-2, WHERE THE ANGELS ENCOUNTER THE PATRIARCH JACOB, BECAUSE OF WHICH HE CALLED THAT CITY ARMY" OR CAMP. FOR THEY WERE HIS TROOPS AND CAMPED AROUND HIM AS A PROTECTION, AS THE PSALM HERE STATES. 34 11 WILL BLESS THE LORD AT I ALL TIMES HIS PRAISE SHALL CONTINUALLY BE I IN MY MOUTH. 2 MY SOUL MAKES ITS BOAST I IN THE LORD ? LET THE HUMBLE HEAR I AND BE GLAD. 3 OH, MAGNIFY THE I LORD WITH ME, AND LET US EXALT HIS NAME TO-1 GETHER! 4 1 SOUGHT THE LORD, AND HE I ANSWERED ME AND DELIVERED ME FROM I ALL MY FEARS. 5 THOSE WHO LOOK TO HIM ARE I RADIANT, AND THEIR FACES SHALL NEVER I BE ASHAMED. 6 THIS POOR MAN CRIED, AND THE LORD I HEARD HIM ! AND SAVED HIM OUT OF ALL HIS I TROUBLES. 7 THE ANGEL OF THE LORD ENCAMPS AROUND THOSE WHO I FEAR HIM, AND DE-1 LIVERS THEM. 8 OH, TASTE AND SEE THAT THE I LORD IS GOOD! BLESS&D IS THE MAN WHO TAKES REF-1 UGE IN HIM! 9 OH, FEAR THE LORD, I YOU HIS SAINTS, FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM I HAVE NO LACK! 10 THE YOUNG LIONS SUFFER WANT AND I HUNGER BUT THOSE WHO SEEK THE LORD LACK I NO GOOD THING. N COME, O CHIDREN, LIS-1 TEN TO ME I WILL TEACH YOU THE FEAR I OF THE LORD. 12 WHAT MAN IS THERE WHO DE-1 SIRES LIFE AND LOVES MANY DAYS, THAT HE MAY I SEE GOOD? PSALM 34 ,3 KEEP YOUR LONGUE FROM I EVIL  AND YOUR LIPS FROM SPEAK-1 MG DECEIT. U TURN AWAY FROM EVIL  AND DO GOOD SEEK PEACE AND PUR- L SUE IT. 15 THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE TOWARD THE I RIGHTEOUS AND HIS EARS I TOWARD THEIR CRY. 16 THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO I EVIL. ' TO CUT OFF THE MEMORY OF THEM L FROM THE EARTH. 17 WHEN THE RIGHTEOUS CRY FOR HELP, THE I LORD HEARS 7 AND DELIVERS THEM OUT OF ALL THEIR I TROUBLES. 18 THE LORD IS NEAR TO THE BROKEN-1 HEARTED AND SAVES THE CRUSHED IN L SPIRIT. 19 MANY ARE THE AFFLICTIONS OF THE I RIGHTEOUS. BUT THE LORD DELIVERS HIM OUT I OF THEM ALL. 20 HE KEEPS I ALL HIS BONES  NOT ONE OF THEM IS I BROKEN. 21 AFFLICTION WILL SLAY THE L WICKED. AND THOSE WHO HATE THE NGHTEOUS WILL I BE CONDEMNED. 22 THE LORD REDEEMS THE LIFE OF HIS L SERVANTS NONE OF THOSE WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM WILL I BE CONDEMNED MAY HR O GOD, SPIRIT OF TRUTH, WHO SPOKE OF OLD BY KINGS AND PROPHETS, ENLIGHTEN THE EYES OF OUR UNDERSTANDING, THAT WE MAY READ ARIGHT THE PSALMS OF YOUR SERVANT DAVID, LEARNING FROM THEM THAT JESUS OF NAZARETH IS HE OF WHOM THE SCRIPTURES SPOKE. CAUSE US EVER MORE CLEARLY TO SEE THAT HE. AND HE ALONE, IS THE SAVIOR OF OUR SOULS, THAT OUR HEART MAY CLING TO HIM ALONE. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER  -- PSALM 35 NE 35TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER IN WHICH DAVID CRIES OUT AGAINST THE SHAMEFUL PEOPLE WHO, FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR ENJOYMENT AND PROFIT, PUT UP A PRETENSE AND SAY WHAT THE RULERS WOULD GLADLY HEAR. THEY DEFAME THE INNO CENT, EMBITTERING THE RULERS AGAINST THEM AND INCITING THEM TO VIOLENCE. THEY DEVOUR THE TRUTH AND CAUSE GREAT HEARTACHE. THIS HAPPENED TO DAVID, UNDER SAUL HIS KING, WHEN THOSE WHOM HE HAD TREATED WELL OFTEN AFFLICTED HIM OUT OF THEIR OWN MALICE. WE TAKE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE FOR OUR OWN TIME, WHEN BOTH IN SERMONS AND IN BOOKS, BY THE PRINCES AND IN EVERY PLACEOUR GOSPEL IS SO SHAMEFULLY DEFAMED WITH GREAT LIES BEYOND MEASURE. THOSE WHOM WE HAVE SERVED WITH ALL DUE HONOR AND RESPECT DO THIS, FOR THE MOST PART. THUS THEY ASCEND AND ARE PRAISED, WHILE WE ARE OVERTHROWN AND DESCEND TO THE GROUND. THIS SHAMEFUL, THANKLESS, EVIL FILTHI NESS IS NOTHING BUT THE ABOMINABLE BELLY WITH ITS SERVANTS. IN SHORT, IT HAPPENS (AS CHRIST SAID OF HIS BETRAYER) THAT HE WHO EATS MY BREAD BETRAYS ME WITH HIS FEETAND DOES SO FOR THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER. SUCH ARE THE HYPOCRITES, WHO FOR THE SAKE OF FOOD WILL DEVOUR THE RIGHTEOUS, AS DAVID HERE CRIES. 33 1 CONTEND, O LORD, WITH THOSE WHO CON-1 TEND WITH ME, FIGHT AGAINST THOSE WHO FIGHT A-1 GAINST ME! 2 TAKE HOLD OF SHIELD AND I BUCKLER AND RISE I FOR MY HELP! 3 DRAW THE SPEAR AND JAVELIN AGAINST MY PUR-1 SUERS! SAY TO MY SOUL, I AM YOUR SAL-1 VATION! PSALM 35 4 LET THEM BE PUT TO SHAME AND DISHONOR WHO SEEK AFTER I MY LIFE! LET THEM BE TURNED BACK AND DISAPPOINTED WHO DEVISE EVIL A- I GAINST ME!  LET THEM BE LIKE CHAFF BE-1 FORE THE WIND| WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD DRIVING I THEM AWAY! 6 LET THEIR WAY BE DARK AND I SLIPPERY| WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD PUR- I SUING THEM! 7 FOR WITHOUT CAUSE THEY HID THEIR I NET FOR ME| WITHOUT CAUSE THEY DUG A PIT I FOR MY LIFE. 8 LET DESTRUCTION COME UPON HIM WHEN HE DOES NOT I KNOW IT| AND LET THE NET THAT HE HID ENSNARE HIM, LET HIM FALL INTO ITTO HIS DE-  STRUCUON! 9 THEN MY SOUL WILL REJOICE I IN THE LORD, EXULTING IN HIS SAL- I VATION. 10 ALL MY BONES SHALL SAY, O LORD, WHO IS I LIKE YOU| DELIVERING THE POOR FROM HIM WHO IS TOO STRONG FOR HIM. THE POOR AND NEEDY FROM HIM WHO I ROBS HIM?" 11 MALICIOUS WITNESSES I RISE UP| THEY ASK ME OF THINGS THAT I I DO NOT KNOW. 12 THEY REPAY ME E- I VIL FOR GOOD| MY SOUL I IS BEREFT. 13 BUT 1, WHEN THEY WERE SICKI WORE SACKCLOTH I AFFLICTED MYSELF WITH I FASTING| 1 PRAYED WITH HEAD BOWED I ON MY CHEST. 14 1 WENT ABOUT AS THOUGH 1 GNEVED FOR MY FNEND OR MY I BROTHER| AS ONE WHO LAMENTS HIS MOTHER, I BOWED DOWN IN I MOURNING. 15 BUT AT MY STUMBLING THEY REJOICED AND I GATHERED| THEY GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST ME WRETCHES WHOM 1 DID NOT KNOW TORE AT ME WITHOUT I CEASING READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 16 LIKE PROFANE MOCKERS I AT A FEAST,' THEY GNASH AT ME I WITH THEIR TEETH. PKAYTR LORD JESUS, WE GIVE THANKS THAT YOU BRUISED THE HEAD OF THE OLD SERPENT AND DELIVERED US FROM HIS POWER. AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE PURCHASED US WITH YOUR HOLY BLOOD, KEEP US YOUR OWN, AND SUFFER NOT THE ENEMY TO SEDUCE OUR HEARTS. LET YOUR ANGELS WAR AGAINST THOSE WHO SEEK OUR SOUL, AND DRIVE THEM FAR FROM US. AMEN. 17 HOW LONG, O LORD, WILL YOU I LOOK ON? : RESCUE ME FROM THEIR DESTRUCTION, MY PRECIOUS LIFE FROM THE I LIONS! 18 1 WILL THANK YOU IN THE GREAT CONGRE-1 GATION IN THE MIGHTY THRONG I WILL I PRAISE YOU. 19 LET NOT THOSE REJOICE OVER ME WHO ARE WRONGFULLY I MY FOES, AND LET NOT THOSE WINK THE EYE WHO HATE ME WITH-1 OUT CAUSE. 20 FOR THEY DO I NOT SPEAK PEACE, BUT AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE QUIET IN THE LAND THEY DEVISE WORDS I OF DECEIT. 2 THEY OPEN WIDE THEIR MOUTHS A-1 GAINST ME THEY SAY, AHA, AHA! OUR EYES HAVE I SEEN IT! 22 YOU HAVE SEEN, O LORD BE NOT I SILENT! O LORD, BE NOT I FAR FROM ME! 23 AWAKE AND ROUSE YOURSELF FOR MY VINDI-1 CATION, FOR MY CAUSE, MY GOD I AND MY LORD! 24 VINDICATE ME, O LORD, MY GOD, ACCORDING TO YOUR I RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND LET THEM NOT REJOICE I OVER ME! 25 LET THEM NOT SAY IN THEIR HEARTS, AHA, OUR I HEARTS DESIRE! PSALM 36 LET THEM NOT SAY. WE HAVE SWAL-1 LOWED HIM UP" 2  LET THEM BE PUT TO SHAME AND DISAPPOINTED ALTOGETHER WHO REJOICE AT MY CA-1 LAMITY!  LET THEM BE CLOTHED W ITH SHAME AND DISHONOR WHO MAGNIFY THEMSELVES A-1 GAINST ME! 27 LET THOSE WHO DELIGHT IN MY RIGHTEOUSNESS SHOUT FOR JOY AND BE GLAD AND SAY ! EVERMORE,  GREAT IS THE LORD, WHO DELIGHTS IN THE WELFARE OF HIS I SERVANT! 28 THEN MY TONGUE SHALL TELL OF YOUR I RIGHTEOUSNESS AND OF YOUR PRAISE ALL I THE DAY LONG. PRAYER LORD, OUR GOD, WHO LOVES RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATES INIQ UITY, RESTRAIN THE ENEMIES OF YOUR KINGDOM, DESTROY THE DEVICES OF THOSE WHO TAKE COUNSEL AGAINST YOUR TRUTH, AND STOP THE MOUTH OF INFIDELS AND BLASPHEMERS, THAT THE KING DOM OF YOUR SON, JESUS CHRIST, MAY BE BUILT, AND RIGHTEOUS NESS AND TRUTH MAY BE SPREAD ABROAD. AMEN. PSALM .IT) HE 36TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION THAT WARNS US TO BE ON GUARD AGAINST FALSE TEACHERS, HERETICS, AND REBEL LIOUS SPIRITS. THESE THINGS THE PSALMIST PRAYS FOR AT THE END. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PSALM HE GIVES US COMFORT THAT DESPITE EVERYTHING. GOD'S WORD AND KINGDOM WILL NOT BE OVER THROWN BY MEANS OF THEIR RABBLE. INSTEAD IT WILL STAND IN ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUNTAIN THAT THE LORD HIMSELF ESTABLISHES AND LIKE THE DEEPEST ABYSS THAT CAN BE SCOOPED OUT. THE LIV ING AND COMFORTING WORD SHALL THUS REMAIN IN THE HOUSE OF GOD. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER THE PSALMIST PORTRAYS THIS MASTERFULLY, SAYING: THEY ARE AN EVIL VENOMOUS PEOPLE WHO, IN THE FIRST PLACE, RECEIVE GODS WORD WITH TOTAL SCORN AND HAVE NO REVERENCE FOR GOD AT ALL. THEY ARE PROUD, IMPUDENT, AND SELF-SECURE, TEACHING WHATEVER THEY PLEASE. SECOND, THEY DO NOT PRAISE OR HONOR GOD BUT HONOR THEMSELVES, WHILE THEY SLANDER ALL OTHER TEACHERS AND BITTERLY REVILE THEM. IN THIS THEY ARE MASTERS, ADORNING THEMSELVES ALONE. NOWHERE ELSE IS THERE ANY SPIRIT, ANY GOD, ANY CHURCH. THIRD, THEIR DOCTRINE IS NOX IOUS, NOTHING BUT LIES WITH WHICH THEY CONTEND AGAINST THE FAITH AND DOCTRINE OF GRACE. THEY DECEIVE THE PEOPLE WITH THEIR FALSE BRILLIANCE AND THEIR LIES. IN THE FOURTH PLACE, THEY ARE RIGID AND STIFF-NECKED, TOLERATING NEITHER INSTRUCTION NOR ADMONISHMENT. THEIR HEAD IS HARDER THAN ANY ANVIL. YES, WHEN THEY SEE THAT SOMEONE REPROVES THEM RATHER THAN PRAISING THEM, THEY BUM AND RAGE AS THE DEVIL HIMSELF. IN THE FIFTH PLACE, THEY CONTINUALLY PUSH ON AN INCREASE, EXPANDING THEIR DOMAIN, AS ST. PAUL SAYS (2 TIMOTHY 2:17), LIKE GANGRENE. FOR THEY PROMOTE THEIR DOCTRINE TEN TIMES MORE STRONGLY AND MORE DILIGENTLY THAN THE TRUE TEACHERS DO, AS IF THEY WOULD OVERTURN EVERYTHING IN ONE DAY. THERE IS NO DAY OFF OR HOLIDAY WITH THEM. FINALLY, WHENEVER POSSIBLE THEY PURSUE AND TORMENT ALL THOSE WHO DO NOT GO ALONG WITH THEM, AND THEY DO THIS WITHOUT DREAD, BUT WITH TOTAL AUDACI TY AND CONFIDENCE, AS IF THEY WERE DOING GOD A SERVICE THEREBY. 36 1 TRANSGRESSION SPEAKS TO THE WICKED DEEP I IN HIS HEART THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BE-1 FORE HIS EYES. 2 FOR HE FLATTERS HIMSELF IN I HIS OWN EYES THAT HIS INIQUITY CANNOT BE FOUND OUT AND I HATED. J THE WORDS OF HIS MOUTH ARE TROUBLE I AND DECEIT HE HAS CEASED TO ACT WISELY I AND DO GOOD. PSALM 36 4 HE PLOTS TROUBLE WHILE I ON HIS BED| HE SETS HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT IS NOT GOOD, HE DOES NOT REJECT I EVIL. 5 YOUR STEADFAST LOVE, O LORD, EXTENDS TO THE I HEAVENS| YOUR FAITHFULNESS I TO THE CLOUDS. 6 YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MOUN-1 TAINS OF GOD| YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP MAN AND BEAST YOU SAVE. I O LORD. 7 HOW PRECIOUS IS YOUR STEADFAST LOVE. I O GOD! THE CHILDREN OF MANKIND TAKE REFUGE IN THE SHADOW I OF YOUR WINGS. 8 THEY FEAST ON THE ABUNDANCE I OF YOUR HOUSE| AND YOU GIVE THEM DNNK FROM THE RIVER OF I YOUR DELIGHTS. 9 FOR WITH YOU IS THE FOUN-1 TAIN OF LIFE| IN YOUR LIGHT DO  WE SEE LIGHT. 10 OH, CONTINUE YOUR STEADFAST LOVE TO THOSE WHO I KNOW YOU| AND YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO THE UP- I RIGHT OF HEART! 11 LET NOT THE FOOT OF ARROGANCE COME UP-1 ON ME| NOR THE HAND OF THE WICKED DRIVE I ME AWAY. 12 THERE THE EVILDOERS LIE I FALLEN| THEY ARE THRUST DOWN, UNABLE I TO RISE. PRAYER LORD JESUS. BISHOP AND SHEPHERD OF YOUR CHURCH ON EARTH, ENLIGHTEN WITH YOUR LIGHT ALL WHO ERR IN THE WAY. AND RESTRAIN ALL THOSE WHO CONRUPT YOUR WORD AND PERVERT YOUR COUNSEL. ALWAYS GRANT TO US PASTORS THAT LEAD US AWAY FROM THE STERILE SANDBARS OF PROUD SCIENCE, BUT TO THE VERDANT FIELDS OF YOUR GOSPEL, AND CREATE IN US HEARTS EAGER TO RECEIVE YOUR SAVING TRUTH. AMEN. 9 | READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER OR PS AIM 57 CXNE 37TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF COMFORT THAT TEACHES AND EXHORTS US TO HAVE PATIENCE IN THE WORLD AND WARNS US, ESPECIALLY, AGAINST ENVY. FOR IT IS VEXING AND PAINFUL TO THE WEAK IN FAITH WHEN THINGS GO SO WELL FOR THE GODLESS AND THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS TO THOSE WHO FEAR GOD. IT IS A GREAT SPIRI TUAL VIRTUE WHENSEEING THE GREAT MISDEEDS OF THE PEAS ANTS, THE TOWNSPEOPLE, THE NOBILITY, THE PRINCES, AND EVERY ONE WHO HAS ANY POWERONE YET EXERTS HIMSELF NOT TO BLAS PHEME OR INWARDLY WISH THIS AND THAT CURSE ON THEM. MOREOVER, HE STILL SUFFERS AND SEES THAT ALL THINGS GO WELL FOR THEM AND THEY REMAIN UNPUNISHED. INDEED, THEY ARE PRAISED AND HONORED, WHILE THE GOD-FEARING ARE MISERABLE, DESPISED, HATED, BEGRUDGED, OBSTRUCTED, VEXED, AND PERSE CUTED. THE MESSAGE IS: LEARN TO HAVE ENDURANCE. TAKE YOUR HEART TO GOD AND DO NOT LET YOURSELF BE VEXED. DO NOT BECOME ENVIOUS, OR CURSE, OR WITH EVIL TO FALL, OR MURMUR, OR LOOK AT THEM WITH HATRED. LET THESE PEOPLE GO AND COMMEND THEM TO GOD, WHO WILL SURELY FIND ALL THINGS OUT. THE PSALM TEACHES THIS AND COMFORTS US IN A VARIETY OF WAYS WITH ABUN DANT PROMISES, WITH EXAMPLES, WITH WARNINGS. FOR IT IS A GREAT AND DIFFICULT ART TO MANIFEST SUCH PATIENT LONGSUFFERING, WHEN REASON AND ALL THE HEATHEN COUNT ENVY AS VIRTUE. FOR IT APPEARS AS THOUGH IT WERE JUST AND FAIR TO ENVY AND BEGRUDGE THE UNGODLY FOR THEIR WANTONNESS, THEIR GOOD FORTUNE, AND THEIR RICHES. PSALM 37 37 1 FRET NOT YOURSELF BECAUSE OF EVIL-1 DOERS" BE NOT ENVIOUS OF WRONG- I DOERS! 2 FOR THEY WILL SOON FADE I LIKE THE GRASS AND WITHER LIKE THE L GREEN HERB. 3 TRUST IN THE LORD, I AND DO GOOD| DWELL IN THE LAND AND BEFRIEND I FAITHFULNESS. 4 DELIGHT YOURSELF I IN THE LORD, AND HE WILL GIVE YOU THE DESIRES I OF YOUR HEART. 5 COMMIT YOUR WAY I TO THE LORD' TRUST IN HIM, AND I HE WILL ACT. 6 HE WILL BRING FORTH YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS I AS THE LIGHT, AND YOUR JUSTICE AS THE I NOONDAY. 7 BE STILL BEFORE THE LORD AND WAIT PATIENTLY L FOR HIM FRET NOT YOURSELF OVER THE ONE WHO PROSPERS IN HIS WAY, OVER THE MAN WHO CARRIES OUT EVIL DE-1 VICES! 8 REFRAIN FROM ANGER, AND FOR- I SAKE WRATH!' FRET NOT YOURSELF IT TENDS ONLY TO I EVIL. 9 FOR THE EVILDOERS SHALL BE I CUT OFF| BUT THOSE WHO WAIT FOR THE LORD SHALL INHER- 1 IT THE LAND. 10 IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE, THE WICKED WILL I BE NO MORE| THOUGH YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT HIS PLACE, HE WILL I NOT BE THERE. 11 BUT THE MEEK SHALL IN-1 HERIT THE LAND AND DELIGHT THEMSELVES IN A- 1 BUNDANT PEACE. 12 THE WICKED PLOTS AGAINST THE I RIGHTEOUS AND GNASHES HIS I TEETH AT HIM. 13 BUT THE LORD LAUGHS AT THE I WICKED| FOR HE SEES THAT HIS DAY IS I COMING. READING THE PSALMS WITH LI THER  THE WICKED DRAW THE SWORD AND I BEND THEIR BOWS TO BRING DOWN THE POOR AND NEEDY, TO SLAY THOSE WHOSE WAY IS I UPRIGHT 15 THEIR SWORD SHALL ENTER I THEIR OWN HEART,  AND THEIR BOWS SHALL BE I BROKEN. 6 BETTER IS THE LITTLE THAT THE I RIGHTEOUS HAS= THAN THE ABUNDANCE OF MANY I WICKED. ,7 FOR THE ARMS OF THE WICKED SHALL BE I BROKEN, BUT THE LORD UPHOLDS THE I RIGHTEOUS. 18 THE LORD KNOWS THE DAYS OF THE ! BLAMELESS, AND THEIR HERITAGE WILL REMAIN FOR- I EVER, 19 THEY ARE NOT PUT TO SHAME IN I EVIL TIMES IN THE DAYS OF FAMINE THEY HAVE A- I BUNDANCE. 20 BUT THE WICKED WILL PERISH THE ENEMIES OF THE LORD ARE LIKE THE GLORY OF THE I PASTURES THEY VANISHLIKE SMOKE THEY VAN- ! ISH AWAY. 21 THE WICKED BORROWS BUT DOES I NOT PAY BACK. BUT THE NGHTEOUS IS GENER- I OUS AND GIVES 22 FOR THOSE BLESSED BY THE LORD SHALL INHER- I IT THE LAND, BUT THOSE CURSED BY HIM SHALL I BE CUT OFF. PRAYER COME, SPIRIT OF THE FATHER, MAKE US YOUR TEMPLES, AND SO GOVERN OUR HEARTS THAT ENVY AND DISCONTENT MAY BE BANISHED FROM US. TEACH US GODLINESS WITH CONTENTMENT, THAT WE MAY ACCOUNT FOOD AND RAIMENT SUFFICIENT FOR THIS LIFE, AND MAY DEVOTE OUR SOULS TO SEEKING THOSE TREASURES THAT THIEVES CAN NOT STEAL AND RUST WILL NOT CORRODE. AMEN. 23 THE STEPS OF A MAN ARE ESTABLISHED 1 BY THE LORD, WHEN HE DELIGHTS I IN HIS WAY 24 THOUGH HE FALL, HE SHALL NOT BE CAST I HEADLONG. FOR THE LORD UP-1 HOLDS HIS HAND. 94 PSALM 37 25 I HAVE BEEN YOUNG, AND L NOW AM OLD," 1 YET I HAVE NOT SEEN THE RIGHTEOUS FORSAKEN OR HIS CHILDREN BEG I GING FOR BREAD 26 HE IS EVER LENDING I GENEROUSLY, 3  1 AND HIS CHILDREN BECOME A I BLESSING. 27 TURN AWAY FROM EVIL  AND DO GOOD SO SHALL YOU DWELL FOR- I EVER. 28 FOR THE LORD LOVES JUSTICE HE WILL NOT FORSAKE HIS SAINTS. THE ARE PRESERVED TOR- I EVER. BUT THE CHILDREN OF THE WICKED SHALL I BE CUT OFT 29 THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL INHER- I IT THE LAND AND DWELL UPON IT FOR I EVER. 30 THE MOUTH OF THE RIGHTEOUS UTTERS I WISDOM. AND HIS LONGUE SPEAKS I JUSTICE. 31 THE LAW OF HIS GOD IS I IN HIS HEART HIS STEPS I DO NOT SLIP. 32 THE WICKED WATCHES FOR THE I RIGHTEOUS AND SEEKS TO PUT I HIM TO DEATH. 33 THE LORD WILL NOT ABANDON HIM I TO HIS POWER OR LET HIM BE CONDEMNED WHEN HE IS I BROUGHT TO TRIAL. 3  WAIT FOR THE LORD AND KEEP HIS WAY. AND HE WILL EXALT YOU TO INHER- I IT THE LAND YOU WILL LOOK ON WHEN THE WICKED I ARE CUT OFT. 35 1 HAVE SEEN A WICKED. I RUTHLESS MAN, SPREADING HIMSELF LIKE A GREEN I LAUREL TREE. 36 BUT HE PASSED AWAY, AND BEHOLD, HE I WAS NO MORE THOUGH I SOUGHT HIM, HE COULD I NOT BE FOUND. 37 MARK THE BLAMELESS AND BEHOLD THE I UPRIGHT, FOR THERE IS A FUTURE FOR THE I MAN OF PEACE. 38 BUT TRANSGRESSORS SHALL BE ALTOGETHER I DESTROYED THE FUTURE OF THE WICKED SHALL I BE CUT OFF. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 39 THE SALVATION OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS I FROM THE LORD HE IS THEIR STRONGHOLD IN THE TIME OF I TROUBLE. 40 THE LORD HELPS THEM AND DE-1 LIVERS THEM HE DELIVERS THEM FROM THE WICKED AND SAVES THEM, BECAUSE THEY TAKE REF-1 UGE IN HIM. PRAYER OH, MAY THIS BOUNTEOUS GOD THROUGH ALL OUR LIFE BE NEAR US. WITH EVER JOYFUL HEARTS AND BLESSED PEACE TO CHEER US AND KEEP US IN HIS GRACE AND GUIDE US WHEN PERPLEXED AND FREE US FROM ALL ILLS IN THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT! AMEN. (LSB 895 2 )  - R NE 38TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER IN WHICH THE PSALMIST LAMENTS OVER HIS SINS, ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH HIS CON SCIENCE DESPAIRS AND IS GREATLY AFFLICTED AND CAN SEE NOTHING BUT GODS ARROWS, THAT IS, GODS ANGER, THREATS, DEATH, AND HELL. THESE SORROWS CONSUME MARROW AND BONE, STRENGTH PSALM 38 AND FLUIDS. THEY DISFIGURE THE APPEARANCE AND THE COMPLEX ION AND ALTER ONES TOTAL UNDERSTANDING AND DEMEANOR. TO TRULY FEEL ONE'S SINS AND DESPAIR OVER A GUILTY CONSCIENCE IS THE TORTURE ABOVE ALL TORTURE. MOREOVER, OUTWARD PERSECUTORS ADD TO THIS COMFORT, PURSUING THE RIGHTEOUS IN THEIR CON SCIENCE AND BOASTING THAT GOD IS WITH THEM AND AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUS. AND BECAUSE GOD HERE HOLDS BACK HIS COMFORT, THIS TERROR IN THE HEART FOLLOWS, THAT GOD IS ANGRY WITH THEM ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR SINS. 96 PSALM 38 BUT FOR ALL THAT, THE PSALMIST TEACHES US TO HOLD FAST AND NOT DESPAIR HE TEACHES US TO ARM OURSELVES WITH PRAYER AGAINST THEIR BOASTS, TO LAY CLAIM TO GODS PROMISE AND TAKE HOLD OF IT TO THE PROPER END, NAMELY, THAT WE BE GODLY AND RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD. THEN THE COMFORT OF FAITH WILL FLOW AGAIN. LIKEWISE, WE. TOO, SHOULD PRAY AND NOT DESPAIR IN ANY ANXIETY, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE SINNERS AND FEEL SHARPLY THE BURDEN AND ASSAULT OF OUR SINS. C ?9 1 O LORD, REBUKE ME NOT IN YOUR I ANGER." NOR DISCIPLINE ME I IN YOUR WRATH! 2 FOR YOUR ARROWS HAVE SUNK I INTO ME. AND YOUR HAND HAS COME 1 DOWN ON ME. 3 THERE IS NO SOUNDNESS IN MY FLESH BECAUSE OF YOUR INDIG- I NATION" THERE IS NO HEALTH IN MY BONES BECAUSE I OF MY SIN. 4 FOR MY INIQUITIES HAVE GONE O- I VER MY HEAD 1  LIKE A HEAVY BURDEN, THEY ARE TOO HEA- I VY FOR ME. 5 MY WOUNDS STINK AND I FESTER BECAUSE OF MY I FOOLISHNESS, 6 1 AM UTTERLY BOWED DOWN AND I PROSTRATE ALL THE DAY 1 GO ABOUT I MOURNING. 7 FOR MY SIDES ARE FILLED WITH I BURNING. 1  AND THERE IS NO SOUNDNESS I IN MY FLESH. 8 1 AM FEEBLE I AND CRUSHED 1  I GROAN BECAUSE OF THE TUMULT I OF MY HEART. 9 O LORD, ALL MY LONGING IS BE- I FORE YOU MY SIGHING IS NOT HID- I DEN FROM YOU. ,0 MY HEART THROBS MY STRENGTH I FAILS ME, AND THE LIGHT OF MY EYESIT ALSO HAS I GONE FROM ME. 11 MY FRIENDS AND COMPANIONS STAND ALOOF I FROM MY PLAGUE, AND MY NEAREST KIN STAND I FAR OFF. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 12 THOSE WHO SEEK MY LIFE LAY THEIR SNARES THOSE WHO SEEK MY HURT SPEAK OF I RUIN AND MEDITATE TREACHERY I ALL DAY LONG. 15 BUT I AM LIKE A DEAF MAN 11 DO NOT HEAR, LIKE A MUTE MAN WHO DOES NOT O-1 PEN HIS MOUTH. 14 1 HAVE BECOME LIKE A MAN WHO I DOES NOT HEAR, AND IN WHOSE MOUTH ARE I NO REBUKES. 15 BUT FOR YOU, O LORD, I DO I WAIT IT IS YOU, O LORD MY GOD, WHO WILL I ANSWER. 16 FOR 1 SAID, ONLY LET THEM NOT REJOICE I OVER ME, WHO BOAST AGAINST ME WHEN MY I FOOT SLIPS! 17 FOR I AM READ-1 Y TO FALL, AND MY PAIN IS EVER BE-1 FORE ME. 18 1 CONFESS MY IN-1 IQUITY I AM SORRY I FOR MY SIN. 19 BUT MY FOES ARE VIGOROUS, THEY ARE I MIGHTY, AND MANY ARE THOSE WHO HATE ME I WRONGFULLY. 20 THOSE WHO RENDER ME E-1 VIL FOR GOOD ACCUSE ME BECAUSE I FOLLOW I AFTER GOOD. 21 DO NOT FORSAKE ME, I O LORD! O MY GOD, BE NOT I FAR FROM ME! 22 MAKE HASTE TO I HELP ME, O LORD, MY SAL-1 VATION! PRAYER LORD, RIGHTEOUS AND MERCIFUL GOD, DO NOT PUNISH US IN YOUR HOT DISPLEASURE, AS WE SO RICHLY DESERVE, BUT BE GRA CIOUS TO US ACCORDING TO YOUR MERCIES, FOR WE ARE POOR AND MISERABLE. DO NOT REMEMBER THE GUILT OF OUR MANY SINS, BUT REMEMBER THE BLOODY MERITS OF YOUR SON, JESUS CHRIST. STRENGTHEN OUR HEARTS WITH THE COMFORTING MINISTRATIONS OF YOUR SPIRIT, AND PRESERVE US IN FAITH AND HOPE UNTO OUR END. AMEN. PSALM 39 OR PSALM JV R  |HE 39TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF COMFORT. THE PSALMIST PRAYS THAT GOD NOT LET HIM MURMUR OR BECOME IMPATIENT, EVEN THOUGH THE GODLESS LIVE SECURELY AND ACCUMULATE GOODS AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER DIE, WHILE THE GODLY ARE CONSTANTLY PLAGUED AND PUNISHED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR SINS. HE DESIRES RATHER THAT GOD WOULD GRANT HIM TO THINK OF HOW SHORT AND UNCERTAIN THIS LIFE IS, LEST HE JOIN THE UNGODLY AND LIVE WITH OUT FEAR OF DEATH IN CARELESS GREED AND VAIN DISPLAY. IT IS A GREAT VEXATION AND TROUBLES MANY HEARTS THAT EVIL LIVES SO CONFIDENTLY IN NOTOUS LIVING, BUT THE GODLY ARE TROU BLED AND IN MISERY. HOWEVER, IN THE END, WE FIND THAT THE BEST OF ALL IS STILL TO HAVE THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND A GRA CIOUS GOD, WHO WILL HELP US OUT OF ANY MISERY, AS THE PSALMIST HERE SAYS AND PRAYS. 39  1 SAID, I WILL GUARD MY WAYS, THAT 1 MAY NOT SIN I WITH MY TONGUE I WILL GUARD MY MOUTH WITH A MUZZLE, SO LONG AS THE WICKED ARE IN MY I PRESENCE. 2 1 WAS MUTE AND SILENT 1 HELD MY PEACE TO I NO AVAIL. 4 AND MY DIS-1 TRESS GREW WORSE. 3 MY HEART BECAME HOT WITHIN ME. AS I MUSED, THE I FIRE BURNED THEN 1 SPOKE I WITH MY TONGUE: 4 O LORD, MAKE ME KNOW MY END AND WHAT IS THE MEASURE I OF MY DAYS LET ME KNOW HOW FLEETING I I AM! 5 BEHOLD, YOU HAVE MADE MY DAYS A FEW I HANDBREADTHS. AND MY LIFETIME IS AS NOTHING BE-1 FORE YOU. 99 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER SURELY ALL MANKIND STANDS AS A I MERE BREATH! 6 SURELY A MAN GOES ABOUT AS A ! SHADOW! SURELY FOR NOTHING THEY ARE IN I TURMOIL MAN HEAPS UP WEALTH AND DOES NOT KNOW WHO WILL I GATHER! 7 AND NOW, O LORD, FOR WHAT I DO I WAIT? MY HOPE I IS IN YOU. 8 DELIVER ME FROM ALL MY TRANS-1 GRESSIONS. DO NOT MAKE ME THE SCORN I OF THE FOOL! 9 1 AM MUTE 1 DO NOT OPEN I MY MOUTH, FOR IT IS YOU WHO HAVE I DONE IT. 10 REMOVE YOUR I STROKE FROM ME I AM SPENT BY THE HOSTILITY I OF YOUR HAND. 11 WHEN YOU DISCIPLINE A MAN WITH REBUKES FOR SIN, YOU CONSUME LIKE A MOTH WHAT IS I DEAR TO HIM SURELY ALL MANKIND IS A I MERE BREATH! 12 HEAR MY PRAYER, O LORD, AND GIVE EAR TO MY CRY HOLD NOT YOUR PEACE I AT MY TEARS! FOR I AM A SOJOURNER WITH YOU, A GUEST, LIKE ALL MY I FATHERS. 13 LOOK AWAY FROM ME, THAT I MAY I SMILE AGAIN, BEFORE 1 DEPART AND I AM NO MORE! PRAYER ALMIGHTY GOD, WHO LIVES FOREVER, BUT HAS SET BOUNDS TO OUR LIVES ON THIS EARTH THAT WE CANNOT PASS, GRANT US TRUE WIS DOM, THAT WE SET NOT OUR HEARTS ON EARTHLY THINGS, NEITHER FOL LOW AFTER MAMMON, BUT SEEK FIRST YOUR KINGDOM AND THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF YOUR SON. BY THE OPERATION OF YOUR SPIRIT TEACH US TO REMEMBER THAT WE ARE BUT PILGRIMS ON THIS EARTH, AND HELP US TO FIX OUR HEARTS AND HOPES ABOVE WHERE CHRIST IS, SITTING ON YOUR THRONE. AMEN. PSALM 40 OR PSALM 40 R 40IH PSALM IS A BEAUTIFUL PSALM OF PRAYER IN WHICH CHNST HIMSELF LAMENTS HIS SUFFERINGS AND CALLS FOR RESCUE FROM DEATH IT CLEARLY PROPHESIES THAT HE ALONE DOES GODS WILL AND FULFILLS THE LAW. AND THAT THIS IS WRITTEN ABOUT HIM IN THE BOOK OF MOSES. CHRIST DISSOLVES AND ABOLISHES THE OLD LAW OF SACRIFICES AND ITS HOLINESS BY WHICH GODS WILL WAS NOT FULFILLED. GOD ALONE DOES EVERYTHING FOR US NOTHING IS DONE BY OUR WORK OR SACRIFICES. HE THEREFORE PROMISES AND ESTABLISHES THE NEW TESTAMENT IN WHICH THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE BELIEVERS WILL BE PREACHED IN THE GREAT CONGREGATION, THAT IS. IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, AND NOT THE JUSTIFI CATION BY SACRIFICES OR OUR WORKS. FOR WORKS AND SACRIFICES MAKE ONLY ARROGANT AND FALSE SAINTS WHOSE HOPE IS NOT IN GOD OR IN HIS GRACE, BUT IN THEIR LIES AND FALSE HOLINESS. 40 1 1 WAITED PATIENTLY I FOR THE LORD HE INCLINED TO ME AND I HEARD MY CRY. 2 HE DREW ME UP FROM THE PIT OF DESTRUCTION, OUT OF THE I MIRY BOG, AND SET MY FEEL UPON A ROCK, MAKING MY I STEPS SECURE. 3 HE PUT A NEW SONG IN MY MOUTH, A SONG OF PRAISE I TO OUR GOD  MANY WILL SEE AND FEAR. AND PUT THEIR TRUST I IN THE LORD. 4 BLESSED IS THE MAN WHO MAKES THE I LORD HIS TRUST. WHO DOES NOT TURN TO THE PROUD, TO THOSE WHO GO ASTRAY AF- 1 TER A LIE! READING THE PSAI.MS WITH LUTHER 5 YOU HAVE MULTIPLIED, O LORD MY GOD, YOUR WONDROUS DEEDS AND YOUR THOUGHTS TOWARD US NONE CAN COM-1 PARE WITH YOU!  I WILL PROCLAIM AND TELL OF THEM, YET THEY ARE MORE THAN ! CAN BE TOLD. 6 SACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, BUT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME AN I OPEN EAR  BURNT OFFERING AND SIN OFFERING YOU HAVE I NOT REQUIRED. 7 THEN 1 SAID, BEHOLD, I I HAVE COME IN THE SCROLL OF THE BOOK IT IS WNT-1 TEN OF ME: 8 1 DESIRE TO DO YOUR WILL, I O MY GOD YOUR LAW IS WITH-1 IN MY HEART 9 I HAVE TOLD THE GLAD NEWS OF DELIVERANCE IN THE GREAT CONGRE-1 GATION BEHOLD, I HAVE NOT RESTRAINED MY LIPS, AS YOU KNOW, I O LORD. ,0 I HAVE NOT HIDDEN YOUR DELIVERANCE WITHIN MY HEART 1 HAVE SPOKEN OF YOUR FAITHFULNESS AND YOUR SAL-1 VATION I HAVE NOT CONCEALED YOUR STEADFAST LOVE AND YOUR FAITHFULNESS FROM THE GREAT CONGRE-1 GATION. N AS FOR YOU, O LORD, YOU WILL NOT RESTRAIN YOUR MER-1 CY FROM ME YOUR STEADFAST LOVE AND YOUR FAITHFULNESS WILL EVER PRE-1 SERVE ME! 12 FOR EVILS HAVE ENCOMPASSED ME BEYOND NUMBER MY INIQUITIES HAVE OVERTAKEN ME, AND 1 I CANNOT SEE THEY ARE MORE THAN THE HAIRS OF MY HEAD MY HEART 1 FAILS ME. 13 BE PLEASED, O LORD, TO DE-1 LIVER ME! O LORD, MAKE HASTE TO I HELP ME! 14 LET THOSE BE PUT TO SHAME AND DISAPPOINTED ALTOGETHER WHO SEEK TO SNATCH A-1 WAY MY LIFE LET THOSE BE TURNED BACK AND BROUGHT TO DISHONOR WHO DE-1 SIRE MY HURT! PSALM 41 IS LET THOSE BE APPALLED BECAUSE I OF THEIR SHAME WHO SAY TO ME, "A-1 HA. AHA! BUT MAY ALL WHO SEEK YOU REJOICE AND BE I GLAD IN YOU MAY THOSE WHO LOVE YOUR SALVATION SAY CONTINUALLY, GREAT I IS THE LORD! 17 AS FOR ME, 1 AM POOR AND NEEDY, BUT THE LORD TAKES I THOUGHT FOR ME  YOU ARE MY HELP AND MY DELIVERER DO NOT DELAY, I O MY GOD! PRAYER WE GIVE THANKS TO YOU, LORD JESUS, FOR YOUR BITTER SUFFER ING AND PAINFUL DEATH, WHEREBY YOU PURCHASED US FROM THE PANGS OF ETERNAL DEATH. THANKS BE TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE SENT US THE WORD OF YOUR SALVATION. PRESERVE IT WITH US PURE AND UNADULTERATED, AND WHENEVER WE HEAR OR READ IT, REVEAL YOURSELF TO US AS THE SAVIOR OF OUR SOULS. AMEN. PSALM 41 R HE 41ST PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER IN WHICH CHRIST HIMSELF PROPHESIES AND LAMENTS OVER HIS BETRAYER, JUDAS, TOGETHER WITH HIS COMRADES, BY WHOM HE WOULD BE CRUCI FIED. HE PRAYS THAT HE WOULD BE RAISED UP FROM DEATH AND THAT HE MIGHT BE ELEVATED TO GOD'S PRESENCE AT HIS RIGHT HAND. BUT CHRIST OFFERS COMFORT FOR THE MULTITUDES BY MAK ING HIMSELF INTO A SINNER, THOUGH TRULY HE WAS WITHOUT ANY SIN. THUS HE STANDS AND DECLARES HIMSELF TO BE IN OUR PLACE, IN OUR PERSON, AND HE CARRIES OUR SINS AS IF THEY WERE HIS OWN, AS IF HE HAD COMMITTED THEM HIMSELF. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER HOWEVER, IN THE BEGINNING OF THE PSALM, HE DECLARES A BLESSING FOR THOSE WHO SHOW REGARD FOR THOSE IN MISERY, THAT IS, THOSE WHO DO NOT BECOME OFFENDED AT JESUS CHRIST, THE MISERABLE CRUCIFIED SINNER, BUT HOLD FAST TO HIM. FOR IT IS VERY OFFENSIVE TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH A POOR, CONDEMNED SIN NER SHOULD BE RAISED SO HIGH THAT HE MAY SIT AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD. 4 | 1 BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO CONSID-1 ERS THE POOR! IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE THE LORD DE- 1 LIVERS HIM 2 THE LORD PROTECTS HIM AND KEEPS HIM ALIVE HE IS CALLED BLESSED I IN THE LAND YOU DO NOT GIVE HIM UP TO THE WILL OF HIS I ENEMIES. I THE LORD SUSTAINS HIM ON HIS I SICKBED IN HIS ILLNESS YOU RESTORE HIM TO I FULL HEALTH. 4 AS FOR ME, I SAID, O LORD, BE GRA-1 CIOUS TO ME HEAL ME, FOR I HAVE SINNED A-1 GAINST YOU! 5 MY ENEMIES SAY OF ME IN I MALICE, WHEN WILL HE DIE AND HIS NAME I PERISH? 6 AND WHEN ONE COMES TO SEE ME, HE UTTERS EMPTY WORDS, WHILE HIS HEART GATHERS IN-1 IQUITY WHEN HE GOES OUT, HE TELLS I IT ABROAD. 7 ALL WHO HATE ME WHISPER TOGETHER A-1 BOUT ME THEY IMAGINE THE I WORST FOR ME. 8 THEY SAY, A DEADLY THING IS POURED I OUT ON HIM HE WILL NOT RISE AGAIN FROM I WHERE HE LIES. 9 EVEN MY CLOSE FRIEND IN WHOM 11 TRUSTED, WHO ATE MY BREAD, HAS LIFTED HIS HEEL A-1 GAINST ME. 10 BUT YOU, O LORD, BE GRA-1 CIOUS TO ME, AND RAISE ME UP, THAT I MAY RE-1 PAY THEM! II BY THIS I KNOW THAT YOU DE-1 LIGHT IN ME: MY ENEMY WILL NOT SHOUT IN TRIUMPH I OVER ME. 24 PSALM 42 2 BUI YOU HAVE UPHELD ME BECAUSE OT MY IN- I TEGRITY.' AND SET ME IN YOUR PRESENCE LOR-1 EVER. 13 BLESSED BE THE LORD, THE GOD OF I ISRAEL. LROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING! AMEN AND I AMEN MAYER LORD JESUS, WHO CAME TO YOUR OWN AND THEY RECEIVED YOU NOT. GRANT US YOUR SPIRIT TO GLORIFY YOU IN OUR HEARTS. ENLIGHTEN OUR SOULS W ITH THIS LIVING KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE THE POWER OF GOD AND THE W ISDOM OF GOD. THAT WE MAY NEVER BE OFFENDED IN YOU. BUT MA HOLD YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IN AN UNWAVERING FAITH, AND MAY NOT BE ASHAMED TO CONFESS YOU BEFORE MEN. AMEN. R  XHE 42ND PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER IN WHICH THE PSALMIST LAMENTS OVER HIS SORROW THAT GOD WAS ANGRY WITH HIM AND HAD AFFLICTED HIM. BECAUSE OF THESE HE IS MOCKED BY THE GODLESS WHO TAUNT. WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW? FOR THE GODLESS CANNOT RESTRAIN THEMSELVES WHEN THEY SEE THAT THINGS GO ILL WITH THE GODLY, THEY WHISTLE, LAUGH, AND WINK: "AH. HOW RIGHTLY THIS COMES TO PASS! SO THEY SAY. "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE HERETICS. WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS TROU BLED, THEY KNOW NOTHING ELSE THAN THAT IT IS A SURE SIGN OF GODS ANGER. BUT WHEN THEY ARE TROUBLED, THEN IT CAN HAVE NO OTHER MEANING THAN THAT THEY ARE SUFFERING FOR GODS SAKE AND THEY MUST BE GODS HOLY MARTYRS THESE WRONGHEADED, BLIND, AND POISONOUS GUIDES FOR THE BLIND WILL NOT UNDER STAND THAT GOD FLOGS HIS OWN PEOPLE, YET COMFORTS THEM AGAIN AND DOES NOT DESERT THEM. THE PSALMIST ON THE OTHER HAND DESIRES TO COME TO GOD'S HOUSE AND BE COMFORTED BY READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER THE FACE OF GOD. THAI IS, HE WANTS TO TRULY HEAR GODS WORD, WHICH COMFORTS HIM. FOR GODS HOUSE IS THAT PLACE WHERE GODS WORD IS, AND GODS FACE IS HIS PRESENCE THROUGH WHICH HE MAKES HIMSELF KNOWN AND, BY MEANS OF HIS WORD, REVEALS HIS GRACE. ELSEWHERE IN THE SCRIPTURE (JEREMIAH 2:27), IT SAYS TO TURN NOT YOUR BACK, BUT YOUR FACE TOWARD GOD. 1 AS A DEER PANTS FOR I FLOWING STREAMS, SO PANTS MY SOUL FOR YOU, I O GOD. 2 MY SOUL THIRSTS FOR GOD, FOR THE I LIVING GOD  WHEN SHALL I COME AND APPEAR BE- I FORE GOD? 3 MY TEARS HAVE BEEN MY FOOD I DAY AND NIGHT, WHILE THEY SAY TO ME CONTINUALLY, WHERE I IS YOUR GOD? 4 THESE THINGS I REMEMBER, AS I POUR I OUT MY SOUL: HOW I WOULD GO WITH THE THRONG AND LEAD THEM IN PROCESSION TO THE I HOUSE OF GOD WITH GLAD SHOUTS AND I SONGS OF PRAISE, A MULTITUDE KEEPING I FESTIVAL. 5 WHY ARE YOU CAST DOWN, O MY SOUL, AND WHY ARE YOU IN TURMOIL WITH-1 IN ME? HOPE IN GOD FOR I SHALL AGAIN PRAISE HIM, MY SALVATION 1 6 AND MY GOD. MY SOUL IS CAST DOWN WITH-1 IN ME THEREFORE I REMEMBER YOU FROM THE LAND OF JORDAN AND OF HERMON, FROM MOUNT I MIZAR. 7 DEEP CALLS TO DEEP AT THE ROAR OF YOUR I WATERFALLS ALL YOUR BREAKERS AND YOUR WAVES HAVE GONE I OVER ME. 8 BY DAY THE LORD COMMANDS HIS STEADFAST LOVE, AND AT NIGHT HIS SONG IS I WITH ME. A PRAYER TO THE GOD I OF MY LIFE. |V6 PSALM 43 9 1 SAY LO GOD. MY ROCK: WH HAVE YOU TOR-1 GOTTEN ME? WHY DO 1 GO MOURNING BECAUSE OF THE OPPRESSION OF THE I ENEMY ?" 10 AS WITH A DEADL WOUND IN MY BONES, MY ADVERSARIES I TAUNT ME, WHILE THEY SAY TO ME CONTINUALLY, WHERE I IS YOUR GOD?" WHY ARE YOU CAST DOWN, 0 MY SOUL, AND WHY ARE YOU IN TURMOIL WITH-1 IN ME 0  HOPE IN GOD: FOR 1 SHALL AGAIN PRAISE HIM, MY SALVATION I AND MY GOD. PR A YER YOU, O LORD, WHO ARE A GOD OF CONSOLATION, COMLORT AND STRENGTHEN ALL STRUGGLING HEARTS, AND SET YOUR BOUNDS TO THE MALICE OF THEIR TEMPTERS AND TORMENTORS. PRESERVE AND LEAD US IN THAT WAY WHICH YOU HAVE MAPPED OUT LOR US. THAT, TAK ING UP OUR CROSS DAILY, WE MAY LOLLOU IN THE LOOTPNNTS OT OUR LORD TO ETERNAL GLORY. AMEN. AND HAS NEARLY THE SAME WORDS IN IT. THE PSALMIST DESIRES ALSO BY LIGHT AND TRUTH TO COME TO GOD'S HOUSE, THAT IS. TO BE COMFORTED IN HIS MISERY BY GOD'S WORD. 27 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 43  VINDICATE ME, O GOD, AND DEFEND MY CAUSE AGAINST AN UNGODLY I PEOPLE,' FROM THE DECEITFUL AND UNJUST MAN DE- 1 LIVER ME! 2 FOR YOU ARE THE GOD IN WHOM I TAKE REFUGE, WHY HAVE YOU RE-1 JECTED ME? ! WHY DO I GO ABOUT MOURNING BECAUSE OF THE OPPRESSION OF THE I ENEMY ? 3 SEND OUT YOUR LIGHT AND YOUR TRUTH LET THEM I LEAD ME LET THEM BRING ME TO YOUR HOLY HILL AND TO YOUR I DWELLING! 4 THEN I WILL GO TO THE ALTAR OF GOD, TO GOD MY EX-1 CEEDING JOY. 1 AND I WILL PRAISE YOU WITH THE LYRE, O I GOD. MY GOD. 5 WHY ARE YOU CAST DOWN. O MY SOUL, AND WHY ARE YOU IN TURMOIL WITH-1 IN ME? HOPE IN GOD FOR I SHALL AGAIN PRAISE HIM, MY SALVATION I AND MY GOD. PRAYER O LORD, GOD OF THE AFFLICTED AND OF ALL WHO ARE SUFFERING WRONGFULLY, HAVE COMPASSION UPON THOSE TEMPTED BY SATAN AND PERSECUTED BY THE WORLD. COMFORT AND STRENGTHEN BOTH THEM AND US BY YOUR WORD AND SPIRIT, UPHOLD US, AND FINALLY DELIVER US FROM ALL EVIL AND RECEIVE US INTO THE EVERLASTING KINGDOM OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. |VS PSALM 44 OR PSALM 44 R 44TH PSALM IS A GENERAL PSALM OF PRAYER IN WHICH ALL THE SAINTS, ESPECIALLY THE NEW TESTAMENT SAINTS, LAMENT THAT THEY ARE PERSECUTED BY THE HEATHEN AND TYRANTS AND WOULD BE SLAUGHTERED. THEY CRY OUT THAT GOD HAS GIVEN THEM OVER TO THIS, AS IF HE HAD ABANDONED THEM. FORMERLY HE HAD HELPED THEM WITH GREAT WONDERS, AND NO HARM CAME TO THEM FROM PERSECUTIONS. BUT THEY ARE NOW EVEN PERSECUT ED ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT, THAT IS, FOR GOD'S SAKE, AS IF THEY HAD DONE ALL KINDS EVIL. IN SUMMARY, THIS PSALM IS THE SIGH ING OF THE SPIRIT. IT REBUKES THE FLESH, WHICH MURMURS AGAINST GOD THAT IT IS JUDGED UNRIGHTEOUS AND IS SO POORLY GOVERNED (ACCORDING TO REASON) THAT THE GODLY, WHO OUGHT TO BE HELPED, ARE ALLOWED TO SUFFER, AND THE EVIL, WHO OUGHT TO BE PUNISHED, ARE ELEVATED. 44 1 O GOD, WE HAVE HEARD WITH OUR EARS, OUR FATHERS HAVE I TOLD US. WHAT DEEDS YOU PERFORMED IN THEIR DAYS, IN THE I DAYS OF OLD: 2 YOU WITH YOUR OWN HAND DROVE OUT THE NATIONS, BUT THEM YOU I PLANTED YOU AFFLICTED THE PEOPLES, BUT THEM YOU I SET FREE 3 FOR NOT BY THEIR OWN SWORD DID THEY WIN THE LAND, NOR DID THEIR OWN ARM I SAVE THEM, BUT YOUR RIGHT HAND AND YOUR ARM, AND THE LIGHT OF YOUR FACE, FOR YOU DE-1 LIGHTED IN THEM. 4 YOU ARE MY KING, I O GOD ORDAIN SALVATION FOR I JACOB! 99 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 5 THROUGH YOU WE PUSH I DOWN OUR FOES THROUGH YOUR NAME WE TREAD DOWN THOSE WHO RISE UP A-1 GAINST US. 6 FOR NOT IN MY BOW I DO I TRUST, NOR CAN MY SWORD I SAVE ME. 7 BUT YOU HAVE SAVED US I FROM OUR FOES AND HAVE PUT TO SHAME THOSE WHO I HATE US. 8 IN GOD WE HAVE BOASTED CON-1 TINUALLY, AND WE WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOUR NAME FOR-1 EVER. PRAYER FATHER OF ALL MERCY, WE THANK YOU FOR SENDING YOUR SON INTO OUR FLESH TO REDEEM US FOR YOURSELF. FOR THE SAKE OF HIS OBEDIENCE AND SUFFERING, GRANT US THE FORGIVENESS OF ALL OUR SINS AND SHORTCOMINGS, AND KEEP US FROM THE EVIL, AS YOUR SON, OUR LORD, PRAYED FOR US. AMEN. 9 BUT YOU HAVE REJECTED US AND DIS-1 GRACED US AND HAVE NOT GONE OUT WITH OUR I ARMIES. 10 YOU HAVE MADE US TURN BACK I FROM THE FOE, AND THOSE WHO HATE US HAVE I GOTTEN SPOIL. N YOU HAVE MADE US LIKE SHEEP FOR I SLAUGHTER AND HAVE SCATTERED US AMONG THE I NATIONS. 12 YOU HAVE SOLD YOUR PEOPLE FOR A I TRIFLE, DEMANDING NO HIGH I PRICE FOR THEM. 13 YOU HAVE MADE US THE TAUNT OF OUR I NEIGHBORS, THE DERISION AND SCORN OF THOSE A-1 ROUND US. 14 YOU HAVE MADE US A BYWORD AMONG THE I NATIONS, A LAUGHINGSTOCK AMONG THE I PEOPLES. 15 ALL DAY LONG MY DISGRACE IS BE-1 FORE ME. AND SHAME HAS COV-1 ERED MY FACE ||F? PSALM 44 16 AT THE SOUND OF THE TAUNTER AND RE-1 VILER, AT THE SIGHT OF THE ENEMY AND THE A-1 VENGER. 17 ALL THIS HAS COME UPON US, THOUGH WE HAVE NOT FOR-1 GOTTEN YOU, AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN FALSE TO YOUR I COVENANT. 8 OUR HEART HAS I NOT TURNED BACK, NOR HAVE OUR STEPS DEPARTED I FROM YOUR WAY 19 YET YOU HAVE BROKEN US IN THE PLACE OF I JACKALS AND COVERED US WITH THE SHAD-1 OW OF DEATH. 20 IF WE HAD FORGOTTEN THE NAME I OF OUR GOD OR SPREAD OUT OUR HANDS TO A I FOREIGN GOD, 21 WOULD NOT GOD DIS-1 COVER THIS? FOR HE KNOWS THE SECRETS I OF THE HEART. 22 YET FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE KILLED ALL THE I DAY LONG WE ARE REGARDED AS SHEEP TO BE I SLAUGHTERED. 23 AWAKE! WHY ARE YOU SLEEPING, I O LORD? ROUSE YOURSELF! DO NOT REJECT US FOR-1 EVER! 24 WHY DO YOU I HIDE YOUR FACE? WHY DO YOU FORGET OUR AFFLICTION AND OP-1 PRESSION? 25 FOR OUR SOUL IS BOWED DOWN I TO THE DUST OUR BELLY CLINGS I TO THE GROUND. 26 RISE UP COME I TO OUR HELP! REDEEM US FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR I STEADFAST LOVE! PRAYER LORD, OUR GRACIOUS FATHER, AT ALL TIMES GRANT US CHRISTIAN RESIGNATION TO THE ORDER AND GUIDANCE OF YOUR PROTECTIVE CARE. PRESERVE US FROM DISCONTENT UNDER THE CROSS, AND FROM ENVY AGAINST THOSE WHO ENJOY PROSPERITY. LEAD US AS YOU WILL, BUT WHEN OUR END COMES, TAKE US HOME TO YOURSELF. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER - PSALM 45 R 45TH PSALM IS A PROPHECY OF THE GOSPEL AND THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST, ADORNED WITH MAGNIFICENT, SPLENDID, AND POWERFUL WORDS. FOR IT PORTRAYS CHRIST AS A KINGWITH ALL KINGLY SPLENDOR, VERY HANDSOME, WELL-SPOKEN, WELL-ADORNED, WELL-ARMORED, SUCCESSFUL IN WAR, RIGHTEOUS, GENTLE, GRA CIOUS, HAVING LIKEWISE A FINE CASTLE, A GRAND HOST OF LADIES- IN-WAITING, A BEAUTIFUL QUEEN, AND CHILDREN FOREVER. THIS ALL IS NOTHING ELSE THAN A SPIRITUAL PICTURE OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST, HIS SPIRIT, GRACE, CHURCH, AND ETERNAL LIFE, OF WAR AGAINST SIN, DEATH, LAW, DEVIL, FLESH, WORLD, AND ALL EVIL. THE PSALM ALSO CLEARLY PROCLAIMS THAT THE OLD TESTAMENT SHALL COME TO AN END. FOR IT CALLS ON THE DAUGHTERS TO FORGET THEIR FATHERS HOUSE AND PEOPLE AND CALL ON THIS KING AS THE ONE GOD, OF WHICH THERE IS NO OTHER GOD. IT GIVES HIM ALSO THE HONOR OF THE FIRST COMMANDMENT, NAMELY PRAYER, AND IT NAMES HIM CLEARLY AS THE TRUE GOD, ACKNOWLEDGING HIM TO BE THE ETERNAL KING WHO RULES IN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LAKES SINS AWAY. AN ETERNAL KING CAN ONLY BE GOD HIMSELF. THIS IS, HOWEVER, NOT THE TIME TO SPEAK FURTHER OF THESE THINGS.  MY HEART OVERFLOWS WITH A PLEASING THEME 1 ADDRESS MY VERSES I TO THE KING MY TONGUE IS LIKE THE PEN OF A I READY SCRIBE. 2 YOU ARE THE MOST HANDSOME OF THE SONS OF MEN GRACE IS POURED UP-1 ON YOUR LIPS THEREFORE GOD HAS BLESSED YOU FOR- I EVER.

THE SCEPTER OF YOUR KINGDOM IS A SCEPTER OF UP-1 RIGHTNESS 7 YOU HAVE LOVED RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HATED I WICKEDNESS. THEREFORE GOD, YOUR GOD, HAS ANOINTED YOU WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS BEYOND YOUR COM- I PANIONS  YOUR ROBES ARE ALL FRAGRANT WITH MYRTH AND ALOES AND I CASSIA. FROM IVORY PALACES STRINGED INSTRUMENTS 1 MAKE YOU GLAD 9 DAUGHTERS OF KINGS ARE AMONG YOUR LADIES OF HONOR AT YOUR RIGHT HAND STANDS THE QUEEN IN GOLD OF I OPHIR. 10 HEAR, O DAUGHTER, AND CONSIDER, AND IN-1 CLINE YOUR EAR  FORGET YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR I FATHERS HOUSE, N AND THE KING WILL DESIRE YOUR I BEAUTY  SINCE HE IS YOUR LORD, I BOW TO HIM. 12 THE PEOPLE OF TRE WILL SEEK YOUR FA-1 VOR WITH GIFTS, THE RICHEST OF THE I PEOPLE. 13 ALL GLORIOUS IS THE PRINCESS IN HER CHAMBER, WITH ROBES INTERWOVEN I WITH GOLD. 14 IN MANY-COLORED ROBES SHE IS LED TO THE KING, WITH HER VIRGIN COMPANIONS FOLLOWING BE- I HIND HER. 15 WITH JOY AND GLADNESS THEY ARE I LED ALONG AS THEY ENTER THE PALACE I OF THE KING. 16 IN PLACE OF YOUR FATHERS SHALL I BE YOUR SONS YOU WILL MAKE THEM PRINCES IN I ALL THE EARTH. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 17 1 WILL CAUSE YOUR NAME TO BE REMEMBERED IN ALL GENER-1 ATIONS THEREFORE NATIONS WILL PRAISE YOU FOREVER AND I EVER. PRAYER LORD JESUS, OUR KING AND SAVIOR, MAKE US YOUR CITIZENS, AND SO GUIDE AND GOVERN US THAT, AS LOYAL SUBJECTS, WE MAY SERVE YOU IN TRUE FAITH AND A GOOD CONSCIENCE ALL THE DAYS OF OUR LIFE. ADOM OUR SOULS WITH YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESSTHE WHITE ROBE IN WHICH WE SHALL BE FOUND PLEASING TO YOUR FATHER AND WORTHY TO DWELL WITH HIM. AMEN. R S HE 46TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS, SUNG BY THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL BECAUSE OF THE MIGHTY DEEDS OF GOD. HE HAD PROTECTED AND SAVED THE CITY OF JERUSALEM, IN WHICH WAS HIS DWELLING, AGAINST ALL THE RAGE AND THE FURY OF ALL THE KINGS AND THE NATIONS AND PRESERVED THEIR PEACE AGAINST ALL WARFARE AND WEAPONS. AND, IN THE MANNER OF THE SCRIPTURES, THE PSALM CALLS THE CHARACTER OF THE CITY A LITTLE STREAM THAT SHALL NOT RUN DRY, AS OPPOSED TO THE GREAT RIVERS, SEAS, AND OCEANS OF THE HEATHENTHEIR GREAT KINGDOMS, PRINCIPALITIES, AND DOMAINSTHAT SHALL DRY UP AND DISAPPEAR. WE, ON THE OTHER HAND, SING THIS PSALM THE BASIS OF LUTHERS HYMN A MIGHTY FORTRESS TO PRAISE GOD FOR BEING WITH US. HE MIRACULOUSLY PRESERVES HIS WORD AND CHRISTENDOM AGAINST THE GATES OF HELL, AGAINST THE RAGE OF THE DEVIL, THE REBELLIOUS SPIRITS, THE WORLD, THE FLESH, SIN. DEATH. OUR LITTLE SPRING OF WATER IS ALSO A LIVING FOUNTAIN, WHILE THEIR PUDDLES, POOLS, AND PONDS BECOME FOUL, MAL ODOROUS, AND DRY. PSALM 46 46  GOD IS OUR REF- I UGE AND STRENGTH.  A VERY PRESENT HELP IN I TROUBLE. 2 THEREFORE WE WILL NOT FEAR THOUGH THE I EARTH GIVES WAY." THOUGH THE MOUNTAINS BE MOVED INTO THE HEART L OF THE SEA. 3 THOUGH ITS WATERS I ROAR AND FOAM."

I WILL BE EXALTED I IN THE EARTH!" N THE LORD OF HOSTS IS I WITH US THE GOD OF JACOB IS OUR I FORTRESS. PRAYER THANKS BE TO YOU, OUR FATHER, FOR ALL THE MERCY AND TRUTH THAT YOU HAVE SHOWN TO US THESE MANY YEARS. GRANT YOUR WORD TO DWELL WITH US CONTINUALLY, DEFEND YOUR CHURCH AGAINST ALL HER ENEMIES, KEEP US IN YOUR GRACE, AND PRESERVE FOR US TEMPORAL AND ETERNAL PEACE THROUGH YOUR SON. JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 47 C|HS, 47TH PSALM IS A PROPHECY OF CHRIST, THAT HE SHALL RISE UP AND BECOME KING OVER ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT A BATTLE, SIMPLY THROUGH SHOUTS, SONGS, AND TRUMPET CALLS, THAT IS, THROUGH THE JOYFUL PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL, JUST AS THE WALLS OF JERICHO FELL BY TRUMPET BLASTS AND SHOUTS, WITHOUT ANY WEAPONS AT ALL. 47  CLAP YOUR HANDS, ALL I PEOPLES! SHOUT TO GOD WITH LOUD I SONGS OF JOY! 2 FOR THE LORD, THE MOST HIGH, IS I TO BE FEARED, A GREAT KING OVER I ALL THE EARTH. 3 HE SUBDUED PEOPLES I UNDER US, AND NATIONS UN-1 DER OUR FEET. 4 HE CHOSE OUR HERITAGE I FOR US, THE PRIDE OF JACOB I WHOM HE LOVES. 5 GOD HAS GONE UP I WITH A SHOUT, THE LORD WITH THE SOUND OF A I TRUMPET. 6 SING PRAISES TO GOD, SING I PRAISES!

PSALM 48 PRA YER THANKS AND PRAISE TO YOU, LORD JESUS CHRIST, FOR YOUR TRIUMPHANT ASCENSION TO HEAVEN, BY WHICH WE KNOW THAT YOUR WORK OF REDEMPTION IS FINISHED AND MANSIONS ARE PRE PARED FOR US IN WHICH WE SHALL BE YOUR ASSOCIATES FOREVER. DRAW OUR AFFECTIONS AFTER YOU THAT, DYING TO THE WORLD, WE MAY LOOK TO THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE ABOVE. GRANT THE LIGHT OF YOUR GOSPEL TO THOSE SITTING IN DARKNESS, AND SPREAD YOUR KINGDOM TO THE REMOTEST ISLES. AMEN. PSALM 4H R HE 48TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS, MUCH LIKE THE 46TH PSALM. IT ALSO PRAISES GOD FOR PROTECTING AND DEFEND ING THE CITY OF JERUSALEM AGAINST THE KINGS AND PRINCES. THEY HAD TO RETREAT IN SHAME AND LET THE TEMPLE STAND, ALONG WITH THE WORSHIP OF GOD AND HIS WORD (OR RULE). WITH THIS GOD HAS KEPT HIS PROMISE, NAMELY, THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FIRST COMMANDMENT, HE WOULD BE THEIR GOD. FOR. THE PSALM SAYS, WHAT WE HAVE HEARD AND BELIEVED, WE ALSO SEE AND EXPERIENCE IN GODS ACTIONS FOR THE CITY. WE ALSO SING THIS PSALM FOR CHRISTENDOM AND THE GOSPEL, THAT THEY WILL STAND AGAINST THE RAGING OF THE KINGS AND PRINCES, WHO FINALLY WITHDRAW IN SHAMEAND THE WORD THEY STILL MUST LET REMAIN. 4  1 GREAT IS THE LORD AND GREATLY I TO BE PRAISED IN THE CITY I OF OUR GOD! HIS HOLY MOUNTAIN , 2 BEAUTIFUL IN ELEVATION, IS THE JOY OF I ALL THE EARTH, IVTADIRNU ME R 3AL.IVIO MM MOUNT ZION, IN THE FAR NORTH, THE CITY OF THE I GREAT KING. 3 WITHIN HER I CITADELS GOD HAS MADE HIMSELF KNOWN AS A L FORTRESS. 4 FOR BEHOLD, THE KINGS AS-1 SEMBLED| THEY CAME ON TO-1 GETHER.

NUMBER HER I TOWERS, 13 CONSIDER WELL HER RAMPARTS, GO THROUGH HER I CITADELS, THAT YOU MAY TELL THE NEXT GENERATION 14 THAT THIS IS GOD, OUR GOD FOREVER AND I EVER. HE WILL GUIDE US FOR-1 EVER. PSALM 49 PRAYER YOU, O GOD, UPHELD YOUR CHURCH AND DEFENDED IT WITH A MIGHTY HAND AND AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OF TYRANNY AND THE WILINESS OF MALICE. YOUR PROTECTION EXTENDS OVER ALL. AND YOUR NAME IS GREAT TO THE VERY ENDS OF THE EARTH. CONTINUE TO SHOW YOURSELF THE GOD OF YOUR PEOPLE, CONVERT THEIR ENEMIES OR RESTRAIN THEIR MALICIOUS COUNSELS, AND KEEP US IN YOUR FAITH AND FEAR THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. PSALM 49 R HE 49TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION AGAINST THE GREAT GOD OF THE WORLD, MAMMON BY NAME. THIS PSALM REBUKES AS GREAT FOOLS THOSE WHO TRUST IN THE WORLDLY GODS RULE AND DO NOT SEE THAT HE CANNOT DELIVER THEMOR HIM SELFFROM DEATH. THEREFORE, IT IS TRULY BETTER TO RELY ON GOD, WHO DELIVERS FROM DEATH AND GIVES ETERNAL LIFE, WHILE THEY PERISH LIKE THE BEAST AND LEAVE ALL THEIR GOODS BEHIND, NOT KNOWING WHO WILL OBTAIN IT ALL. 49 1 HEAR THIS, ALL I PEOPLES! GIVE EAR, ALL INHABITANTS I OF THE WORLD, 2 BOTH I LOW AND HIGH, RICH AND POOR TO-1 GETHER! 3 MY MOUTH SHALL SPEAK I WISDOM THE MEDITATION OF MY HEART SHALL BE UNDER-1 STANDING. 4 1 WILL INCLINE MY EAR TO A I PROVERB I WILL SOLVE MY RIDDLE TO THE MUSIC I OF THE LYRE. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 5 WHY SHOULD 1 FEAR IN LIMES OF I TROUBLE, WHEN THE INIQUITY OF THOSE WHO CHEAT ME SUR-1 ROUNDS ME, 6 THOSE WHO TRUST I IN THEIR WEALTH AND BOAST OF THE ABUNDANCE OF THEIR I RICHES? 7 TRULY NO MAN CAN RANSOM AN-1 OTHER, OR GIVE TO GOD THE PRICE ! OF HIS LIFE, 8 FOR THE RANSOM OF THEIR LIFE IS I COSTLY AND CAN NEV-1 ER SUFFICE, 9 THAT HE SHOULD LIVE ON FOR-1 EVER AND NEVER I SEE THE PIT. 10 FOR HE SEES THAT EVEN THE I WISE DIE THE FOOL AND THE STUPID ALIKE MUST PERISH AND LEAVE THEIR WEALTH TO I OTHERS. 11 THEIR GRAVES ARE THEIR HOMES FOREVER, THEIR DWELLING PLACES TO ALL GENER-1 ATIONS, THOUGH THEY CALLED LANDS BY THEIR I OWN NAMES. 12 MAN IN HIS POMP WILL I NOT REMAIN HE IS LIKE THE BEASTS THAT I PERISH. N THIS IS THE PATH OF THOSE WHO HAVE FOOLISH I CONFIDENCE YET AFTER THEM PEOPLE APPROVE I OF THEIR BOASTS. 14 LIKE SHEEP THEY ARE APPOINTED FOR SHEOL DEATH SHALL BE THEIR  SHEPHERD, AND THE UPRIGHT SHALL RULE OVER THEM IN THE MORNING. THEIR FORM SHALL BE CONSUMED IN SHEOL, WITH NO I PLACE TO DWELL. ,S BUT GOD WILL RANSOM MY SOUL FROM THE POWER 1 OF SHEOL, FOR HE WILL RE-1 CEIVE ME. 16 BE NOT AFRAID WHEN A MAN BE-1 COMES RICH, WHEN THE GLORY OF HIS HOUSE IN-1 CREASES. PSALM 50 U FOR WHEN HE DIES HE WILL CARRY NOTH- L ING AWAY HIS GLORY WILL NOT GO DOWN I AFTER HIM. ! FOR THOUGH, WHILE HE LIVES, HE COUNTS HIMSELF I BLESSED, AND THOUGH YOU GEL PRAISE WHEN YOU DO WELL I FOR YOURSELF 19 HIS SOUL WILL GO TO THE GENERATION OF HIS L FATHERS. 1 WHO WILL NEVER AGAIN I SEE LIGHT. 20 MAN IN HIS POMP YET WITHOUT UNDER I STANDING IS LIKE THE BEASTS THAT I PENSH PR AYR R LORD, OUR GOD, PRESERVE OUR HEARTS FROM COVETOUSNESS, AND GRANT US TRUE WISDOM THAT WE SEEK NOT AFTER THE TREASURES OF THIS EARTH, NOR PUT OUR TRUST IN UNCERTAIN RICHES FILL OUR HEARTS WITH CONTENTMENT, THAT, SATISFIED WITH DAILY BREAD, WE SEEK FIRST THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST AND INHERIT WITH HIM. AMEN. PSALM 50 AIM 50 IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION THAT TELLS US OF THE TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD AND TRUE SACRIFICE IN CONTRAST TO THE FALSE SAINTS. THEY VALUE THEIR OWN SACRIFICES AND WORSHIP HIGHLY, AS IF GOD MUST SURELY BE THANKFUL AND INDEBTED TO THEM. GOD. HOWEVER, REVERSES THIS. HE INTENDS FOR HIS GOOD NESS AND HELP TO BE SO HIGHLY ESTEEMED THAT WE WILL BE THANKFUL AND INDEBTED TO HIM. LIKEWISE, WHEN THE PSALM COMMANDS THAT VOWS BE FUL FILLED, THIS DOES NOT MEAN ABSURD SELF-CHOSEN VOWS, BUT THOSE THAT ARE COMMANDED IN THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. || ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST AND SECONDTHAT WE PRAISE GOD, THAT WE TRUST IN HIM, CALL ON HIM, PRAISE AND THANK HIM AS OUR ONLY GOD, AND THE LIKE. OF THIS, THE RAVING SAINTS AND THE HYPOCRITES KNOW NOTHING. MARK WELL THE CLEAR WORDS WITH WHICH THE PSALM CLOSES. THE LAST VERSE LEACHES US THAT TO CALL UPON GOD IN DISTRESS AND THANK HIM IS THE TRUE WORSHIP, THE MOST PLEASING OFFER ING, AND THE RIGHT WAY TO SALVATION. 1 THE MIGHTY ONE, GOD THE LORD, SPEAKS AND SUM-1 MONS THE EARTH FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN TO ITS I SETTING. 2 OUT OF ZION, THE PERFECTION OF I BEAUTY, GOD ! SHINES FORTH. 3 OUR GOD COMES HE DOES NOT KEEP I SILENCE BEFORE HIM IS A DEVOURING FIRE, AROUND HIM A MIGHTY I TEMPEST. 4 HE CALLS TO THE HEAV-1 ENS ABOVE AND TO THE EARTH, THAT HE MAY JUDGE HIS I PEOPLE: 5 GATHER TO ME MY I FAITHFUL ONES, WHO MADE A COVENANT WITH ME BY I SACRIFICE! 6 THE HEAVENS DECLARE HIS I RIGHTEOUSNESS, FOR GOD HIM-1 SELF IS JUDGE! 7 HEAR, O MY PEOPLE, AND I WILL SPEAK O ISRAEL, 1 WILL TESTIFY A-1 GAINST YOU. I AM 1 GOD, YOUR GOD. 8 NOT FOR YOUR SACRIFICES DO I RE-1 BUKE YOU YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS ARE CONTINUALLY BE-1 FORE ME. 9 I WILL NOT ACCEPT A BULL I FROM YOUR HOUSE OR GOATS I FROM YOUR FOLDS. 10 FOR EVERY BEAST OF THE FOR- I EST IS MINE. THE CATTLE ON A I THOUSAND HILLS. PSALM 50 111 KNOW ALL THE BIRDS I OF THE HILLS, AND ALL THAT MOVES IN THE I FIELD IS MINE. I IF I WERE HUNGRY, I WOULD NOT I TELL YOU, FOR THE WORLD AND ITS FULL-1 NESS ARE MINE. U DO I EAT THE I FLESH OF BULLS OR DRINK THE I BLOOD OF GOATS? N OFFER TO GOD A SACRIFICE OF THANKS-1 GIVING, AND PERFORM YOUR VOWS TO THE I MOST HIGH, IS AND CALL UPON ME IN THE DAY OF I TROUBLE I WILL DELIVER YOU, AND YOU SHALL GLO-1 RIFY ME." 16 BUT TO THE WICKED I GOD SAYS: WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO RECITE MY STATUTES OR TAKE MY COVENANT I ON YOUR LIPS? 1 7 FOR YOU HATE I DISCIPLINE, AND YOU CAST MY WORDS BE-1 HIND YOU.  IF YOU SEE A THIEF, YOU ARE I PLEASED WITH HIM, AND YOU KEEP COMPANY WITH A-1 DULTERERS. ,9 YOU GIVE YOUR MOUTH FREE REIN FOR I EVIL, AND YOUR TONGUE I FRAMES DECEIT. 20 YOU SIT AND SPEAK AGAINST YOUR I BROTHER YOU SLANDER YOUR OWN I MOTHERS SON. 2  THESE THINGS YOU HAVE DONE, AND I HAVE BEEN SILENT YOU THOUGHT THAT I WAS ONE I LIKE YOURSELF. BUT NOW I REBUKE YOU AND LAY THE CHARGE BE-1 FORE YOU. 22 MARK THIS, THEN, YOU WHO FOR-1 GET GOD, LEST I TEAR YOU APART, AND THERE BE NONE TO DE-1 LIVER! 23 THE ONE WHO OFFERS THANKSGIVING AS HIS SACRIFICE GLO-1 RIFLES ME TO ONE WHO ORDERS HIS WAY RIGHTLY 1 WILL SHOW THE SALVA-1 TION OF GOD! READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PRAYER LORD, OUR SAVIOR, ENLIGHTEN OUR EYES TO KNOW ALL YOUR MERCIES, AND CREATE IN US SUCH HEARTS THAT MAY BE TRULY GRATE FUL TO YOU. FORGIVE US OUR SINS FOR THE SAKE OF THE SACRIFICE OF YOUR SON ON THE CROSS. ENLARGE OUR HEARTS TO WALK IN THE WAY OF YOUR COMMANDMENTS, AND TO PAY TO YOU THE SACRED VOW MADE IN HOLY BAPTISM. AMEN. PSALM 51 R  ALM 51 IS ONE OF THE FOREMOST OF THE PSALMS OF INSTRUCTION. IN IT DAVID TRULY TEACHES US WHAT SIN IS, WHERE IT COMES FROM, WHAT DAMAGE IT DOESAND HOW ONE MAY BE FREED FROM IT. IN THIS PSALM, AS NOWHERE ELSE, IT IS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT SIN IS AN INHERITANCE, BOM IN US, AND THAT NO WORKS CAN HELP US AGAINST IT, ONLY GODS GRACE AND FORGIVE NESS. THROUGH HIS SPIRIT. HE CREATES US NEW AGAIN, AS A NEW PERSON, A NEW CREATION. OTHERWISE, SAYS DAVID, SIN WITH ITS TERROR AND DESPAIR IS SO MIGHTY THAT IT EVEN CRUSHES THE BONES, UNTIL GODS GRACE COMES TO OUR COMFORT. AFTERWARD, WHEN BY GRACE AND THE SPIRIT WE HAVE AGAIN BECOME NEW, THEN WE NOT ONLY LEARN HOW TO PRAISE, BUT ACTU ALLY THANK AND PRAISE GODYES, EVEN SUFFER AND BEAR THE CROSS. ALL OF THIS DAVID CALLS TRUE SACRIFICE AND WORSHIP. HE REJECTS ALL OTHER SACRIFICES THAT THE RAVING SAINTS BNNG. HE PRAYS AT THE END THAT GOD MIGHT BUILD UP AND PRESERVE THE CITY OF JERUSALEM TO SUCH SACRIFICES AND WORSHIP. PSALM 51  5 | 1 HAVE MERCY ON ME, O GOD. ACCORDING TO YOUR I STEADFAST LOVE 1 ACCORDING TO YOUR ABUNDANT MERCY BLOT OUT MY TRANS- I GRESSIONS. 2 WASH ME THOROUGHLY FROM MY IN- I IQUITY. AND CLEANSE ME I FROM MY SIN!

AND UPHOLD ME WITH A WILLING I SPIRIT 1J THEN I WILL TEACH TRANSGRESSSORS I YOUR WAYS. AND SINNERS WILL RE- I TURN TO YOU. 14 DELIVER ME FROM BLOODGUILTINESS. O GOD. O GOD OF MY SAL-1 VATION, AND MY TONGUE WILL SING ALOUD OF YOUR I RIGHTEOUSNESS. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER IS O LORD, OPEN I MY LIPS, AND MY MOUTH WILL DE-1 CLARE YOUR PRAISE. 16 FOR YOU WILL NOT DELIGHT IN SACRIFICE, OR I WOULD I GIVE IT YOU WILL NOT BE PLEASED WITH A BURNT I OFFERING. 17 THE SACRIFICES OF GOD ARE A BROKEN I SPIRIT A BROKEN AND CONTRITE HEART, O GOD, YOU WILL I NOT DESPISE. 18 DO GOOD TO ZION IN YOUR GOOD I PLEASURE BUILD UP THE WALLS OF JE-1 RUSALEM 19 THEN WILL YOU DELIGHT IN RIGHT SACRIFICES, IN BURNT OFFERINGS AND WHOLE BURNT I OFFERINGS THEN BULLS WILL BE OFFERED ON YOUR I ALTAR. PRAYER O GOD, OUR MERCIFUL FATHER, BY YOUR HOLY LAW DO YOU WORK IN US THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF OUR SIN, THAT OUR HEART MAY BE PENITENT, AND OUR SOUL HUMBLE BEFORE YOU. BLOT OUT OUR INIQUITIES WITH THE BLOOD OF YOUR SON, CLEANSE OUR SOULS FROM THE DARK SPOTS WITH WHICH WE HAVE SOILED THEM, AND COMFORT US WITH THE ASSURANCE OF YOUR GRACE. BUILD YOUR CHURCH WITH US AND OUR CHILDREN, THAT YOUR NAME MAY BE GLORIFIED BY MANY GENERATIONS. AMEN. PSALM 52 52ND PSALM IS A PSALM OF COMFORT. AS THE TITLE SHOWS, IT SPEAKS OF DOEG, WHO BETRAYED DAVID AND SHED MUCH INNOCENT BLOOD (1 SAMUEL 22). HE WAS A TRAITOR AND BLOODTHIRSTY DOG, WHO SLANDERED THOSE WHO HOPE IN GODS WORD. HE REVILED GODS SERVANTS AND INCITED KINGS AND PRINCES TO SHED INNOCENT BLOOD. DESPITE SUCH MALEVOLENT K26 PSALM 52 PEOPLE, THIS PSALM BRINGS COMFORT. IT ANNOUNCES THEIR REWARD, THAT THEY SHALL BE REMOVED FROM BODY, GOODS, HOUSE, AND LAND. BUT THE GODLY SHALL REMAIN AND RETAIN GODS HOUSE AND HIS WORD. 1 WHY DO YOU BOAST OF EVIL, O I MIGHTY MAN? THE STEADFAST LOVE OF GOD ENDURES I ALL THE DAY. 2 YOUR LONGUE PLOTS DE- I STRUCTION, LIKE A SHARP RAZOR, YOU WORKER I OF DECEIT. 3 YOU LOVE EVIL I MORE THAN GOOD. AND LYING MORE THAN SPEAKING I WHAT IS RIGHT. 4 YOU LOVE ALL WORDS I THAT DEVOUR, O DE-1 CEITFUL TONGUE. 5 BUT GOD WILL BREAK YOU DOWN FOR-1 EVER HE WILL SNATCH AND TEAR YOU FROM YOUR LENT HE WILL UPROOT YOU FROM THE LAND OF THE I LIVING. 6 THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL I SEE AND FEAR, AND SHALL LAUGH AT HIM, I SAYING, 7 SEE THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT MAKE GOD HIS I REFUGE. BUT TRUSTED IN THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS RICHES AND SOUGHT REFUGE IN HIS OWN DE-1 STRUCTION! 8 BUT 1 AM LIKE A GREEN OLIVE TREE IN THE I HOUSE OF GOD  1 TRUST IN THE STEADFAST LOVE OF GOD FOREVER AND I EVER. 9 1 WILL THANK YOU FOREVER, BECAUSE YOU HAVE I DONE IT. I WILL WAIT FOR YOUR NAME. FOR IT IS GOOD, IN THE PRESENCE OF THE I GODLY. PRAYER LORD, RIGHTEOUS AND ALMIGHTY GOD, REMEMBER YOUR WEATH ER-BEATEN AND TEMPEST-TOSSED CHURCH ON THIS EARTH. RESTRAIN HER ENEMIES, DESTROY THEIR WILES, AND HINDER THEIR VIOLENCE. PRESERVE YOUR SAVING TRUTH TO US AND OUR CHILDREN, AND GRANT US TO PRAISE YOU WITH A JOYFUL HEART, NOW IN THE CHURCH MILITANT AND FOREVER IN THE CHURCH TRIUMPHANT. AMEN. PSALM 53 R 53RD PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION AND A PROPHECY, MUCH LIKE THE 14TH PSALM. BOTH HAVE NEARLY THE SAME VERSES AND WORDS. IN BRIEF, BOTH OF THEM REBUKE THE FAITHLESS WORK-SAINTS, WHO PERSECUTE THE TRUE DOCTRINE AND THE TRUE TEACHERS. AT THE END, IT PROCLAIMS THE GOSPEL AND KINGDOM OF CHRIST, WHO SHALL COME OUT OF ZION. S3 1 THE FOOL SAYS IN HIS HEART, THERE I IS NO GOD. THEY ARE CORRUPT, DOING ABOMINABLE INIQUITY THERE IS NONE I WHO DOES GOOD. 2 GOD LOOKS DOWN FROM HEAVEN ON THE CHIL-1 DREN OF MAN TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY WHO UNDERSTAND, WHO SEEK I AFTER GOD. 5 THEY HAVE ALL FALLEN AWAY TOGETHER THEY HAVE BE-1 COME CORRUPT THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, NOT I EVEN ONE. 4 HAVE THOSE WHO WORK EVIL NO I KNOWLEDGE, WHO EAT UP MY PEOPLE AS THEY EAT BREAD, AND DO NOT CALL UP-1 ON GOD? 5 THERE THEY ARE, IN GREAT TERROR, WHERE THERE IS NO 1 TERROR! FOR GOD SCATTERS THE BONES OF HIM WHO ENCAMPS AGAINST YOU YOU PUT THEM TO SHAME, FOR GOD HAS RE-1 JECTED THEM. 6 OH, THAT SALVATION FOR ISRAEL WOULD COME OUT OF I ZION! WHEN GOD RESTORES THE FORTUNES OF HIS PEOPLE, LET JACOB REJOICE, LET ISRAEL I BE GLAD. PSALM 54 HR AYER LORD, OUR SAVIOR, FORTIFY OUR HEARTS WITH THE FAITH OF YOUR WORD AGAINST THE FOUL CONTAMINATION OF THE INFIDELITY OF THESE LAST DAYS, WHEN FOLLY IS CALLED SCIENCE, AND IS LAUDED TO THE SKIES. CAUSE US TO GROW IN FAITH, THAT OUR HEARTS MAY BE ROOTED AND GROUNDED IN THE SAVING TRUTH OF YOUR WORD, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. GY- PSALM 54 R SHE 54TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS WHO SEEK THE LIFE OF THE GODLY ON ACCOUNT OF THE WORD OF GOD. THUS SAUL AND THOSE IN ZIPH HAD ATTEMPTED TO KILL DAVID ON ACCOUNT OF THE WORD OF GOD, THROUGH WHICH HE HAD BEEN CALLED AND CONSECRATED TO BE KING. THE PSALMIST PRAYS FOR DELIVERANCE FROM HIS ENEMIES AND FOR VENGEANCE UPON THEM. 54 1 O GOD, SAVE ME, I BY YOUR NAME, AND VINDICATE ME I BY YOUR MIGHT. 2 O GOD, I HEAR MY PRAYER GIVE EAR TO THE WORDS I OF MY MOUTH. 5 FOR STRANGERS HAVE RISEN AGAINST ME RUTHLESS MEN I SEEK MY LIFE THEY DO NOT SET GOD BE-1 FORE THEMSELVES. 4 BEHOLD, GOD IS MY I HELPER THE LORD IS THE UPHOLDER I OF MY LIFE. 5 HE WILL RETURN THE EVIL TO MY I ENEMIES IN YOUR FAITHFULNESS PUT AN I END TO THEM. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 6 WITH A FREEWILL OFFERING I WILL SACRI- I FICE TO YOU 1 WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOUR NAME, 0 LORD, FOR I IT IS GOOD. 7 FOR HE HAS DELIVERED ME FROM EVERY I TROUBLE, AND MY EYE HAS LOOKED IN TRIUMPH ON MY I ENEMIES. PRAYER LORD, OUR GOD, WHO DESIRES NOT THE DEATH OF THE WICKED, CONVERT THOSE WHO HATE US WITHOUT A CAUSE, AND TURN THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO PERSECUTE YOUR CHRISTIANS. PROTECT THE POOR AND THE INNOCENT AGAINST THE OPPRESSION OF UNJUST MEN. GRANT US PATIENCE UNDER THE CROSS, AND PRESERVE US IN THE TRUE FAITH TO OUR END. AMEN. PSALM 55 R S HE 55TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER. ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST AGAINST HIS BETRAYER, JUDAS, 1 RATHER LET IT REMAIN A GENERAL PRAYER AGAINST THOSE VILE ALLEY CATS WHO LICK IN FRONT AND SCRATCH IN BACK. IN APPEARANCE, THEY ARE SUCH TRUE FRIENDS, FATHERS, BROTHERS, AND SISTERS, SO FULL OF LOVE AND LIFE COMPARED TO US, THAT THEIR MOUTH IS SMOOTHER THAN BUTTER AND OIL. BUT BEHIND THE SCENE IS NOTHING BUT MURDER, SWORD, WARFARE, AND THE DESTRUCTION OF ALL, AS THE PSALM SAYS HERE. THAT IS, THEY CAN GO WITH US TO THE TABLE, TO CHURCH, IN HOUSE, ON THE STREET, AND BE THE BEST OF COMPANIONS. THEREFORE, THE DEVIL OR DEATH AND HELL MAY CARRY THEM AWAY, FOR THEY CREATE A GREAT HEARTACHE AND AFFLICTION FOR THE PEOPLE. THIS CURSE, HOWEV ER, IS A PROPHECYTHUS IT WILL CERTAINLY BE WITH THEM, FOR THEY CAN SAY NOTHING BETTER.

WHO FORCED DAVID TO FLEE OUT OF THE LAND TO THE PHILISTINES THEY PRESSED HIM SO HARD THAT HE HAD NOWHERE HE COULD SAFELY GO. BUT DAVID HAD THE COMFORT OF GODS WORD AND THE PROMISE AND RIGHT OF THE KINGSHIP, THOUGH THEY DAILY ASSAILED IT AND OPPOSED OR EVEN DENIED IT. SAYING THAT HE SHALL NEVER BE KING, BUT RATHER SAUL AND HIS HEIRS. WE PRAY THIS PSALM AGAINST OUR TYRANTS, WHO CEASELESSLY PERSECUTE GODS WORD AND US AND ALLOW NO PLACE FOR PEACE BUT WE ALSO HAVE THIS COMFORT, THAT WE HAVE GODS WORD ON OUR BEHALF, THOUGH THEY DAILY OPPOSE, ASSAIL, AND SPEAK AGAINST THAT WORD, SAYING THAT WE ARE HERETICS AND THEY ALONE ARE THE TRUE CHURCH.

OR PSALM 57 R S HE 57TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER IN WHICH DAVID ONCE AGAIN COMPLAINS ABOUT SAUL AND HIS SERVANTSWHEN HE CRAWLED AWAY FROM THEM INTO THE CAVE. IT HAS THE SAME MEANING AS THE PRECEDING PSALM. THEREFORE, WE WOULD MAKE USE OF IT ALSO AGAINST THE TYRANTS AND THEIR VENOMOUS COUN SELORS AND SLANDERERS, WHO TWIST GODS WORD AGAINST US. THEY HAVE THE FANGS AND TONGUE FOR SUCH WORK, WHICH ARE AS DAVID SAYSSPEARS, ARROWS, AND SHARP SWORDS. BUT THANKS BE TO GOD. WHO DOES NOT DESERT US.

(3) A SLUG STRETCHES OUT IT ANTENNAE, BUT BEFORE IT MOVES, IT IS DRIED UP OR MELTED AWAY. (4) A STILL BORN CHILD ENLARGES THE MOTHERS WOMB, AS IF IT WILL COME AS A BABY, BUT DIES BEFORE IT SEES THE LIGHT. (5) A THORN BUSH MAY STICK OUT WITH MANY SPIKES AND THREATEN WITH PRICKS AND SCRATCHES, BUT BEFORE IT BECOMES FULLY DEVELOPED AND HARD, A RAGING HATCHET DESCENDS ON IT AND SUMMONS THE THORNS INTO THE OVEN TO BECOME ASHES. THOUGH ALL OF THESE INTENDED TO BE GREAT AND PROCEED WITH SUCCESS, NEVERTHELESS NOTHING SHALL COME FROM THEM.  5  1 DO YOU INDEED DECREE WHAT IS I RIGHT, YOU GODS?

PRAYER LORD, THE SUPREME JUDGE OVER ALL THE EARTH, THANKS BE TO YOU, BECAUSE YOU JUDGE EQUALLY AND DEAL RIGHTLY WITH THE CHILDREN OF MEN, ABASING THE WICKED AND EXALTING THE PIOUS. TEACH US TO TRUST YOUR PROVIDENCE, AND WHETHER WE REST ON BEDS OF EASE OR MUST WADE THROUGH TURBULENT WATERS, GRANT US GRACE ALWAYS TO SAY: THE LORD IS GOOD AND HIS WAYS ARE RIGHT. AMEN. C-HE 59TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER AND CAN VERY WELL BE SPOKEN IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST, WHO LAMENTED OVER THOSE WHO BY THEIR TEACHINGS STOOD ARRAYED AGAINST HIM, TO CONDEMN AND DISAVOW HIM. THEREBY THEY HAVE THEIR PSALM 59 REWARD: THEY COME INTO THE CITY AT EVENING LIKE HUNGRY DOGS, YET FIND NOTHING. THE PSALM, HOWEVER, CAN ALSO BE UNDERSTOOD FROM THE HISTORY OF DAVID AGAINST HIS "SAULITES. WHO ALSO ARE FINALLY W ITHOUT A KINGDOM AND WANDER AROUND LIKE HUNGRY DOGS UNTIL THEY ARE TOTALLY DESTROYED.

GOVERNMENT, W HICH TRULY IS A PRECIOUS JEWEL BEFORE DAVID, IN THE TUNE OF SAUL, THE GOVERNMENT WAS DISUNITED AND CHAOTIC, AS THE FIRST THREE VERSES DECLARE THE PHILISTINES PLAGUED THEM SORELY, SO THAT THEY DID NOT TAKE MUCH CARE EVEN TOR THE ARK OT GOD (1 CHRONICLES 13). EVIL THINGS PROSPERED, ALONG WITH MUCH UNNGHTEOUSNESS. THIS IS HOW IT WILL ALWAYS BE WHERE GOD IS NOT AT HOME DAVIDS EXAMPLE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT SAUL HAD EVIL ROGUES IN PLACE IN HIS COURT YET (DAVID SAYS). GOD KEPT A BANNER, A SIGN, IN PLACE TOR HIS PEOPLE, SO THEY MIGHT RISE UP AND PRAISE HIM THROUGH IT THEY COULD BE SURE AND SECURE IN HIS GRACE THIS SIGN WAS THE TENT OF MOSES AND THE ARK OF THE COVENANT WITH THE SEAT OT GRACE, WHICH GOD ALSO BROUGHT OUT OF THE LAND OF THE PHILIS TINES WITH GREAT WONDERS. BEFORE THE ARK THEY PRAYED AND CALLED ON GOD AND WERE ACCORDINGLY DELIVERED FROM THEIR DISTRESS. THEREAFTER, DAVID LISTS HIS LAND AND PEOPLE, BEGINNING WITH THE HOLY SANCTUARY AND GODS WORD, THEN SHECHEM. SUCCOTH, GILEAD. MANASSEH. EPHRAIM. JUDAH. MOAB. EDOM. PHILISTIA. FINALLY, HE GIVES A CONFESSION CONCERNING THESE THINGS: TO HAVE A FORTIFIED CITY, THAT IS. A GOOD PEACEFUL GOV ERNMENT TO HAVE VICTORY OVER EDOM, THAT IS. TO PREVAIL OVER PEOPLE AND LAND AND IN THE MIDDLE OF BATTLE THESE ARE NOT HUMAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT GIFTS FROM GOD. WHY HE NAMES NO MORE LANDS OR TRIBES THAN THE NINE HE NAMES BELONGS IN A COMMENTARY- RATHER THAN THIS SUMMARY . WE ALSO CAN SAY THIS PSALM IN PRAISE OF GOD. THAT HE HAS EXTENDED HIS CHURCH INTO THE WHOLE WORLD AND INTO MANY PARISHES AND SEMINARIES, WHERE EACH MAY HAVE THE WORD OF GOD AND ALL HAVE THEIR VARIOUS GIFTS. || READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 66 ? 1 O GOD, YOU HAVE REJECTED US, BROKEN OUR DE- I FENSES YOU HAVE BEEN ANGRY OH, RE- I STORE US. 2 YOU HAVE MADE THE LAND TO QUAKE YOU HAVE TOM IT I OPEN REPAIR ITS BREACHES, FOR IT I TOTTERS. 3 YOU HAVE MADE YOUR PEOPLE SEE I HARD THINGS YOU HAVE GIVEN US WINE TO DRINK THAT MADE US I STAGGER. 4 YOU HAVE SET UP A BANNER FOR THOSE WHO I FEAR YOU, THAT THEY MAY FLEE TO IT I FROM THE BOW. 5 THAT YOUR BELOVED ONES MAY BE DE- I LIVERED, GIVE SALVATION BY YOUR RIGHT HAND AND I ANSWER US! 6 GOD HAS SPOKEN IN HIS I HOLINESS: WITH EXULTATION 1 WILL DIVIDE UP SHECHEM AND PORTION OUT THE VALE OF I SUCCOTH. 7 GILEAD IS MINE MANASSEH IS MINE EPHRAIM IS MY I HELMET JUDAH IS MY I SCEPTER. 8 MOAB IS MY WASHBASIN UPON EDOM I I CAST MY SHOE OVER PHILISTIA I SHOUT IN I TRIUMPH. 9 WHO WILL BRING ME TO THE FORTIFIED I CITY?

THERE ARE MANY WHO, HAVING THE FAVOR OF A PRINCE OR A NOBLE OR THE GOOD WILL OF THE RICH AND POWERFUL, THINK THAT THEY NEED NOTHING MORE, THEN DO MUCH HARM. PARTICULARLY, WHERE THEY SEE A TOTTERING WALL, THAT IS, WHEN THEY NOTICE THAT SOMEONE IS NOT WELL LOOKED UPON IN THE PALACE OR ELSE IS IN NEED AND IS PERSECUTED BY ANOTHER SO THAT HE CANNOT DEFEND HIMSELF, THEN THEY ALL BECOME KNIGHTS, AND THEY THOROUGHLY FLATTER AND PLAY UP TO THE GREAT NOBLES. THEY DO NOT SEE HOW ENTIRELY VAIN IS SUCH TRUST IN PNNCES AND ALSO DO NOT BELIEVE, UNTIL IT HAPPENS, HOW THOROUGHLY IT SHALL COL LAPSE. THEREFORE, IT IS SAID: TRUST GOD. AND DO WRONG TO NO ONE WHO STANDS BEFORE GOD OR MEN. 1 FOR GOD ALONE MY SOUL WAITS IN I SILENCE FROM HIM COMES MY SAL- I VATION. 2 HE ONLY IS MY ROCK AND MY SALVATION, MY I FORTRESS I SHALL NOT BE GREATLY I SHAKEN. 3 HOW LONG WILL ALL OF YOU ATTACK A MAN TO I BATTER HIM, 1 2 3 4 5 LIKE A LEANING WALL, A I TOTTERING FENCE? 4 THEY ONLY PLAN TO THRUST HIM DOWN FROM HIS HIGH POSITION. THEY TAKE PLEASURE IN I FALSEHOOD  THEY BLESS WITH THEIR MOUTHS, BUT INWARDLY I THEY CURSE. 5 FOR GOD ALONE, O MY SOUL, WAIT IN I SILENCE, FOR MY HOPE IS I FROM HIM.

FOR YOU WILL RENDER I TO A MAN ACCORDING I TO HIS WORK. PRAYER LORD, OUR GOD, OUR SURE REFUGE IN NEED, GRANT US TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER, AND TO HONOR AND OBEY THOSE YOU HAVE PLACED OVER US. BUT TEACH US BY YOUR SPIRIT TO TRUST ALONE IN YOU, AND NOT TO MAKE FLESH OUR ARMS, THAT WE MAY LOOK TO YOU ALONE FOR OUR SALVATION THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. |46 PSALM 63 OR PSALM 6.I 63RD PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER IN WHICH DAVID, WHEN HE HAD TO FLEE INTO THE WILDERNESS FROM SAUL, DESIRED TO BE IN THE HOLY PLACE AND HEAR GODS WORD. HE LAMENTS OVER THE SAULITES WHO SEEK HIS LIFE SO THAT HE CAN NOT COME THERE AND THUS IS DEPRIVED OF THE WORD OF GOD. BUT HE MEDITATES, NEVERTHELESS, ON THE PROMISE AND GOD'S CHOICE OF HIM TO BE KING, AND HE COMFORTS HIMSELF WITH THESE IN THE MEANTIME. NOW, HOWEVER, THIS IS A PSALM PEOPLE CAN PRAY, THOSE WHO HOLD ONLY GODS WORD UNDER THE TYRANTS AND YET ARE DEPNVED OF THAT WORD. THEY CONSIDER THEMSELVES STILL AS GODS CHILDREN AND HEIRS BECAUSE THEY HAVE FAITH AND LOVE IN HIS WORD, UNTIL THEIR SAUL FINDS HIS END. 63 1 O GOD, YOU ARE MY GOD EARNESTLY I I SEEK YOU 4 MY SOUL THIRSTS FOR YOU MY FLESH FAINTS FOR YOU, AS IN A DRY AND WEARY LAND WHERE THERE IS NO I WATER. 2 SO I HAVE LOOKED UPON YOU IN THE SANCTU-1 ARY, 4 BEHOLDING YOUR POWER AND I GLORY. 3 BECAUSE YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IS BET-1 TER THAN LIFE, 4 MY LIPS WILL I PRAISE YOU. 4 SO 1 WILL BLESS YOU AS LONG I AS I LIVE IN YOUR NAME I WILL LIFT I UP MY HANDS. 5 MY SOUL WILL BE SATISFIED AS WITH FAT AND I RICH FOOD, AND MY MOUTH WILL PRAISE YOU WITH I JOYFUL LIPS. 6 WHEN I REMEMBER YOU UP-1 ON MY BED, AND MEDITATE ON YOU IN THE WATCHES I OF THE NIGHT S4?

AS WE HAVE OFTEN STATED, THIS IS THE NEW AND PROPER WORSHIP OF GOD. FOR HE DOES NOT SAY THAT THE GENTILES SHALL CIRCUMCISE THEMSELVES AND RUN TO JERUSALEM, BUT RATHER THAT THEY WILL REMAIN GENTILES AND NEVERTHELESS GIVE THANKS TO GOD, BE JOYFUL, AND FEAR HIM, THAT IS, WORSHIP HIM. |S4 PSALM 67 67 1 MAY GOD BE GRACIOUS TO US AND I BLESS US AND MAKE HIS FACE TO SHINE UP- I ON US, 2 THAT YOUR WAY MAY BE I KNOWN ON EARTH.

THE PSALM CALLS THE APOSTLES KINGS AND LORDS OF ARMIES AND LEADERS IN BATTLE BECAUSE, WITH THE GOSPEL, THEY DO BATTLE AGAINST DEATH, SIN, AND THE DEVIL, AGAINST THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF THE WORLD. LIKEWISE, IT CALLS THEM HIGH FRUITFUL MOUNTAINS, GODS HEIRS, AND GODS CHARIOTS WITH MANY HOSTS. IT ALSO CALLS THEM SINGERS AND CHORUSES AMONG THE MAIDENS, DANCERS, AND SINGERSBECAUSE THEY JOYFULLY PRAISE, GLORIFY, AND THANK GOD. THUS DAVID SINGS HIS SONG OF JOY OVER THE HOLY KING DOM OF GRACE AND LIFE. HE PRAYS AT THE END THAT GOD KEEP HIS KINGDOM, BLESS IT, AND ESTABLISH IT TO ETERNITY.

HE CON FESSES IN OUR PLACE AND LAMENTS FOR HIS CRUCIFERS AND SLAN DERERS WHO, IN HIS GREAT THIRST, GAVE HIM GALL AND VINEGAR TO DRINK. (SO CLEARLY AND OPENLY HE SPEAKS OF HIS SUFFERING TO COME.) THEN HE PROPHESIES OF THE HOMBLE DELUSION, HARD NESS OF HEART, AND ULTIMATE DEFEAT OF THE JEWS, WHICH HAS ALL COME ABOUT, AS WE CAN STILL SEE AND SORROW OVER. FINALLY, HE ANNOUNCES ALSO THE NEW WORSHIP. HE SAYS, I WILL PRAISE THE NAME OF GOD . . . AND MAGNIFY HIM WITH THANKSGIVING. THIS WORSHIP SHALL PUT AN END TO THE OLD, FOR IT PLEASES GOD BELTER THAN ALL BULLS AND THE BEST OFFERINGS ONE CAN PROVIDE, AS THE PSALM HERE SAYS. 69 1 SAVE ME, I O GOD!

IT PRAYS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THE TIME OF OLD AGE. WHEN ONE BECOMES FEEBLE AND GRAY. THAT IS. IT PRAYS FOR THE LAST CHRISTIANS, TOR WHOM THE TIMES WILL BE DANGEROUS, AND WHEN FAITHTOGETHER WITH THE GOSPELWILL BE CAST DOWN. IN THE SAME WAY, DANIEL ALSO PROCLAIMED THAT THE TRUTH WOULD BE CAST DOWN AND UNRIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL CONQUER. THEREFORE, THE PSALMIST PRAISES GODS RIGHTEOUSNESS ALONE, WHICH HE HAS LEARNED FROM GOD SINCE HIS YOUTH, OR SINCE THE BEGINNING. MAY THIS BE A COMFORTING PROPHECY FOR US, THAT GODS WORD SHALL RETURN BEFORE THE END OF THE WORLD. WITH THIS WORD GOD WILL CALL US FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH AND MIGHTILY COMFORT US. FROM THIS BASIS COMES ALSO THE GENER AL STATEMENT CONCERNING CHRIST: THAT ELIJAH AND ENOCH SHALL COME, THE LIES OF THE ANTICHRIST SHALL BE EXPOSED, AND ALL SHALL AGAIN BE SET RIGHT. 7 | 1 IN YOU.

GRANT US HEARTS TO APPRECIATE YOUR TRUTH, THAT WE MAY STEAD FASTLY CONTINUE IN YOUR WORD, AND MAY ESCAPE THE SNARES OF THESE EVIL DAYS. AMEN. PSALM 72 R 72ND PSALM IS AN EXCEEDINGLY MAGNIFICENT AND BEAUTIFUL PROPHECY OF CHRIST AND HIS RULE IN THE WHOLE WORLD. IN THIS KINGDOM, NEITHEdIN NOR THE EVIL CONSCIENCE SHALL FLOWER AND REIGN (AS UNDER THE LAW) BUT ONLY RIGH TEOUSNESS, FREEDOM, AND JOY OF CONSCIENCE. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT WITHOUT THE CROSS. ON ACCOUNT OF THE CROSS, THEIR BLOOD SHALL BE SHED AND COUNTED AS VERY PRECIOUS TO GOD. AND THE PSALM ALSO ANNOUNCES THE NEW WORSHIP, WHICH IS TO CALL ON GOD AND TO THANK HIM. HE TELLS US TO PRAY TO GOD DAILY AND DAILY TO PRAISE HIM. THIS IS OUR DAILY OFFERING AMONG ALL THE GENTILES. AT THIS TIME WE HEAR NOTHING OF CIRCUMCISION, NOR THAT THE KINGS AND GENTILES SHOULD RECEIVE THE LAW OF MOSES, BUT RATHER THAT THEY REMAIN KINGS AND GENTILES AND RECEIVE THIS KING AS TRULY GOD BY NATURE, CALL ON HIM, AND GLORIFY HIM. FOR TO CALL ON GOD IN DISTRESS AND TO THANK HIM FOR HIS HELP IS THE WORSHIP THAT ALONE PLEASES HIM, WHO IS ALONE OUR HELPER IN NEED AND OUR SAVIOR. WITHOUT HIM, ALL ELSE IS NO HELP AT ALL. AS PSALM 72  GIVE THE KING YOUR JUSTICE, I O GOD. AND YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO THE I ROYAL SON! 2 MAY HE JUDGE YOUR PEOPLE WITH L RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND YOUR POOR WITH  JUSTICE! 3 LET THE MOUNTAINS BEAR PROSPERITY FOR THE I PEOPLE, AND THE HILLS, IN I RIGHTEOUSNESS! 4 MAY HE DEFEND THE CAUSE OF THE POOR OF THE PEOPLE, GIVE DELIVERANCE TO THE CHILDREN OF THE I NEEDY, AND CRUSH THE OP-1 PRESSOR! S MAY THEY FEAR YOU WHILE THE I SUN ENDURES, AND AS LONG AS THE MOON, THROUGHOUT ALL GENER-1 ATIONS! 6 MAY HE BE LIKE RAIN THAT FALLS ON THE I MOWN GRASS, LIKE SHOWERS THAT WA-1 TER THE EARTH! 7 IN HIS DAYS MAY THE RIGHTEOUS I FLOURISH, AND PEACE ABOUND, TILL THE MOON I BE NO MORE! 8 MAY HE HAVE DOMINION FROM I SEA TO SEA, AND FROM THE RIVER TO THE ENDS I OF THE EARTH! 9 MAY DESERT TRIBES BOW DOWN BE-1 FORE HIM AND HIS ENEMIES I LICK THE DUST! 10 MAY THE KINGS OF TARSHISH AND OF THE COASTLANDS RENDER HIM I TRIBUTE MAY THE KINGS OF SHEBA AND SEBA I BRING GIFTS! 11 MAY ALL KINGS FALL DOWN BE-1 FORE HIM, ALL NATIONS I SERVE HIM! 12 FOR HE DELIVERS THE NEEDY I WHEN HE CALLS, THE POOR AND HIM WHO HAS NO I HELPER. 13 HE HAS PITY ON THE WEAK AND THE I NEEDY, AND SAVES THE LIVES OF THE I NEEDY. 14 FROM OPPRESSION AND VIOLENCE HE RE-1 DEEMS THEIR LIFE, AND PRECIOUS IS THEIR BLOOD I IN HIS SIGHT. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 15 LONG MAY HE LIVE MAY GOLD OF SHEBA BE GIV-1 EN TO HIM!

PRESERVE IN US THIS SAVING KNOWLEDGE, THAT WE MAY HEAR HIS VOICE WITH JOY, AND MAY GO WITH HIM INTO HIS ETERNAL KING DOM. AMEN. PSALM 73 R 73RD PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION AGAINST THE GREAT VEXATION THAT THE GODLESS ARE RICH AND EVERYTHING GOES WELL FOR THEM. THEY RIDICULE THE POOR AND AFFLICTED SAINTS AS IF GOD NEITHER KNEW NOR REGARDED THEM. THEY CON SIDER ONLY THEMSELVES AND THEIR HOLY WORKS AND WHAT THEY TAUGHT AND SAID AS PRECIOUS, HEAVENLY, AND GODLY WISDOM AND HOLINESS. THIS CAUSES MUCH PAIN, SO THAT THE PSALMIST SAYS, I WAS BRUTISH AND IGNORANT.. . TOWARD YOU, THAT IS, I WAS CALLED A GODLESS HERETIC AND DESPISER OF GOD. THEN, HE SAYS: SLOP! GO INTO THE SANCTUARY AND HEAR WHAT GODS WORD SAYS OF THEM. LOOK AT THE FORMER EXAMPLES IN THE HIS TORIES, AND YOU WILL FIND THAT THEY ALL AT ONCE COME TO NOTH ING, FOR THERE IS NO GROUND OR FOUNDATION UNDER THEM, BUT ONLY SLIPPERY FOOTING. 73 1 TRULY GOD IS GOOD TO I ISRAEL, TO THOSE WHO ARE I PURE IN HEART. 2 BUT AS FOR ME, MY FEET HAD ALMOST I STUMBLED, MY STEPS HAD I NEARLY SLIPPED. 3 FOR I WAS ENVIOUS OF THE I ARROGANT WHEN I SAW THE PROSPERITY OF THE I WICKED. 4 FOR THEY HAVE NO PANGS I UNTIL DEATH THEIR BODIES ARE I FAT AND SLEEK. 5 THEY ARE NOT IN TROUBLE AS I OTHERS ARE THEY ARE NOT STRICKEN LIKE THE REST OF I MANKIND. 6 THEREFORE PRIDE IS THEIR I NECKLACE VIOLENCE COVERS THEM AS A I GARMENT. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 7 THEIR EYES SWELL OUT THROUGH I FATNESS THEIR HEARTS OVERFLOW WITH I FOLLIES. 8 THEY SCOFF AND SPEAK WITH I MALICE LOFTILY THEY THREATEN OP-1 PRESSION. 9 THEY SET THEIR MOUTHS AGAINST THE I HEAVENS, AND THEIR TONGUE STRUTS I THROUGH THE EARTH. 10 THEREFORE HIS PEOPLE TURN I BACK TO THEM, AND FIND NO I FAULT IN THEM. 11 AND THEY SAY, HOW CAN I GOD KNOW? IS THERE KNOWLEDGE IN THE I MOST HIGH? U BEHOLD, THESE ARE THE I WICKED ALWAYS AT EASE, THEY INCREASE IN I RICHES. 13 ALL IN VAIN HAVE I KEPT MY I HEART CLEAN AND WASHED MY HANDS IN I INNOCENCE. 14 FOR ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE BEEN I STRICKEN AND REBUKED EVERY I MORNING. 15 IF I HAD SAID, I WILL I SPEAK THUS, I WOULD HAVE BETRAYED THE GENERATION OF YOUR I CHILDREN. PRAYER LORD, THE ONLY WISE GOD, WHOSE THOUGHTS AND WAYS ARE AS HIGH ABOVE OURS AS THE HEAVENS ARE HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH, HIDDEN ARE YOUR WAYS, AND YOUR GUIDANCE OFTEN BEYOND OUR SEARCHING OUT. WORK IN US SUCH HEARTS THAT DO NOT MURMUR AGAINST YOUR JUDGMENTS, BUT ARE ALWAYS READY TO SAY: YOU ARE THE LORD, MY GOD, AND YOU DO ALL THINGS WELL. AMEN. PSALM 73 16 BUT WHEN I THOUGHT HOW TO UNDER- L STAND THIS| IT SEEMED TO ME A I WEARISOME TASK, 17 UNTIL I WENT INTO THE SANCTUARY I OF GOD| THEN I DIS-1 CEMED THEIR END. 18 TRULY YOU SET THEM IN SLIPPERY I PLACES| YOU MAKE THEM FALL TO I RUIN. 19 HOW THEY ARE DESTROYED IN A I MOMENT," SWEPT AWAY UTTERLY BY I TERRORS! 20 LIKE A DREAM WHEN I ONE AWAKES| O LORD, WHEN YOU ROUSE YOURSELF, YOU DESPISE THEM AS I PHANTOMS. 21 WHEN MY SOUL WAS EM-1 BITTERED| WHEN I WAS I PNCKED IN HEART, 22 I WAS BRUTISH AND I IGNORANT| I WAS LIKE A I BEAST TOWARD YOU. 23 NEVERTHELESS, 1 AM CONTINUALLY I WITH YOU YOU HOLD MY I RIGHT HAND. 24 YOU GUIDE ME WITH YOUR I COUNSEL, R AND AFTERWARD YOU WILL RECEIVE ME TO I GLORY. 25 WHOM HAVE I IN I HEAVEN BUT YOU 9  AND THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH THAT I DESIRE BE-1 SIDES YOU. 26 MY FLESH AND MY I HEART MAY FAIL, BUT GOD IS THE STRENGTH OF MY HEART AND MY PORTION FOR-1 EVER. 27 FOR BEHOLD, THOSE WHO ARE FAR FROM YOU SHALL I PERISH YOU PUT AN END TO EVERYONE WHO IS UNFAITHFUL I TO YOU. 78 BUT FOR ME IT IS GOOD TO BE I NEAR GOD I HAVE MADE THE LORD GOD MY REFUGE, THAT I MAY TELL OF I ALL YOUR WORKS. |Z3 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PR A YER LORD, OUR GOD. YOU HAVE A COUNSEL OF MERCY OVER US BY WHICH YOU DESIRE TO LEAD US TO THOSE MANSIONS PREPARED FOR US BY JESUS, OUR SAVIOR. YOU SEE THAT WE ARE IGNORANT, AND OFTEN KNOW NOW WHAT IS FOR OUR GOOD. BY YOUR GRACE RESTRAIN US FROM THRUSTING OUR HAND INTO YOUR CLOCKWORK AND THWART ING YOUR COUNSEL. IN ALL THINGS GRANT US RESIGNATION TO YOUR WILL, THAT WE MAY REACH THE HOME OF THE SOUL WITH CHRIST, OUR LORD. AMEN. PSALM 74 R NE 74TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER AGAINST THE ENEMIES WHO HAD LAID WASTE JERUSALEM, THE TEMPLE, AND ALL THE SCHOOLS OF GOD IN THE LAND, TOGETHER WITH THE CITIES. MOREOVER, THEY SLANDERED GOD, SAYING HE COULD NOT HELP HIS PEOPLE. HOWEVER, THE PSALM APPEARS AS IF IT WERE A PRAYER AGAINST THE DESTRUCTION STILL TO COME, THAT IS, OF THE BABYLONIANS AND THEREAFTER BY ANTIOCHUS EPHIPHANES. FOR ONLY IN THESE TWO INSTANCES WAS THE TEMPLE IN JERUSALEM AND THE LAND DESTROYED. ACCORDINGLY, WE PRAY THIS PSALM AGAINST THOSE WHO DEVASTATE CHRISTENDOM, TEAR UP GODS WORD, SACRAMENTS, AND ALL OF GODS ORDINANCES, AND THUS CLEARLY PREACH ABOMINATION AND SLANDER, AND WHO CONTINUE EVERY WHERE. PSALM 74 74T 1 O GOD, WHY DO YOU CAST US OFF FOR- I EVER? WHY DOES YOUR ANGER SMOKE AGAINST THE SHEEP OF YOUR I PASTURE? 2 REMEMBER YOUR CONGREGATION, WHICH YOU HAVE PURCHASED OF OLD, WHICH YOU HAVE REDEEMED TO BE THE TRIBE OF YOUR I HERITAGE! REMEMBER MOUNT ZION, WHERE I YOU HAVE DWELT. 3 DIRECT YOUR STEPS TO THE PERPETUAL I RUINS THE ENEMY HAS DESTROYED EVERYTHING IN THE SANCTU- I ARY! 4 YOUR FOES HAVE ROARED IN THE MIDST OF YOUR I MEETING PLACE THEY SET UP THEIR OWN I SIGNS FOR SIGNS. 5 THEY WERE LIKE THOSE WHO SWING I AXES IN A FOR-1 EST OF TREES. 6 AND ALL ITS I CARVED WOOD THEY BROKE DOWN WITH HATCHETS AND I HAMMERS. 7 THEY SET YOUR SANCTUARY I ON FIRE THEY PROFANED THE DWELLING PLACE OF YOUR NAME, BRINGING IT DOWN I TO THE GROUND. 8 THEY SAID TO THEMSELVES, WE WILL UTTERLY SUB- I DUE THEM THEY BURNED ALL THE MEETING PLACES OF GOD I IN THE LAND. 9 WE DO NOT I SEE OUR SIGNS THERE IS NO LONGER ANY PROPHET, AND THERE IS NONE AMONG US WHO I KNOWS HOW LONG. 10 HOW LONG, O GOD, IS THE I FOE TO SCOFF? IS THE ENEMY TO REVILE YOUR NAME FOR-1 EVER? 11 WHY DO YOU HOLD BACK YOUR HAND, YOUR I RIGHT HAND? TAKE IT FROM THE FOLD OF YOUR GARMENT AND DE- I STROY THEM! READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PRAYER LORD JESUS CHRIST, YOUR POWR MAKE KNOWN, FOR YOU ARE LORD OF LORDS ALONE DEFEND YOUR HOLY CHURCH THAT WE MAY SING YOUR PRAISE ETERNALLY. AMEN. (Z-SA655:2) 12 YET GOD MY KING IS I FROM OF OLD, WORKING SALVATION IN THE MIDST I OF THE EARTH. 15 YOU DIVIDED THE SEA I BY YOUR MIGHT YOU BROKE THE HEADS OF THE SEA MONSTERS ON THE I WATERS. H YOU CRUSHED THE HEADS OF LE-1 VIATHAN YOU GAVE HIM AS FOOD FOR THE CREATURES OF THE I WILDERNESS. 15 YOU SPLIT OPEN 1 SPRINGS AND BROOKS YOU DRIED UP EVER-1 FLOWING STREAMS. 16 YOURS IS THE DAY, YOURS AL-1 SO THE NIGHT YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED THE HEAVENLY LIGHTS I AND THE SUN. 1 7 YOU HAVE FIXED ALL THE BOUNDARIES I OF THE EARTH YOU HAVE MADE SUMMER AND I WINTER. REMEMBER THIS, O LORD, HOW THE EN- 1 EMY SCOFFS, AND A FOOLISH PEOPLE RE-1 VILES YOUR NAME. 19 DO NOT DELIVER THE SOUL OF YOUR DOVE TO THE I WILD BEASTS DO NOT FORGET THE LIFE OF YOUR POOR FOR-1 EVER. 20 HAVE REGARD FOR THE I COVENANT, FOR THE DARK PLACES OF THE LAND ARE FULL OF THE HABITATIONS OF VIOLENCE. 21 LET NOT THE DOWNTRODDEN TURN I BACK IN SHAME LET THE POOR AND NEEDY I PRAISE YOUR NAME. 22 ARISE, O GOD, DE-1 FEND YOUR CAUSE REMEMBER HOW THE FOOLISH SCOFF AT YOU I ALL THE DAY! PSALM 75 23 DO NOT FORGET THE CLAMOR I OF YOUR FOES, THE UPROAR OF THOSE WHO RISE AGAINST YOU, WHICH GOES UP CON- I TINUALLY! PRAYER O FATHER, SON, AND HOLY GHOST, OUR COVENANT GOD, YOU HAVE PROMISED US THE CLEANSING FROM SIN IN THE BLOOD OF THE LAMB, AND HAVE OBLIGATED YOURSELF TO BE A MERCIFUL FATHER TO US. GRANT US THE SPIRIT OF FAITH, THAT WE MAY TRUST THE WORD OF YOUR COVENANT, AND NOT DOUBT YOUR FAITHFULNESS THROUGH CHRIST, OUR LORD. AMEN. CP" PSALM 75 R X NE 75TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF COMFORT AGAINST THE STIFF-NECKED, PROUD, GODLESS TEACHERS WHO ARE SELF-SECURE AND PRESUME ON THEIR OFFICE, AS IF THEY NEED FEAR NOTHING, NEITHER THREAT NOR PUNISHMENT. AS PSALM 73 ABOVE HAS WRIT TEN: WHO SHALL BE OUR TEACHER? WE ARE THE TEACHERS! WE SIT IN THE OFFICE, WE HAVE THE POWER, AND ALL MUST OBEY US OR BE EXCOMMUNICATED AS HERETICS. SO ALSO TODAY OUR SECURE PRINCES AND THE REBELLIOUS SPIRITS SIT AS SPIRITUAL AND WORLD LY TYRANTS, THINKING THAT GOD HIMSELF CAN NEITHER SEE NOR OVERTHROW THEM. BUT THIS PSALM SAYS OTHERWISE. IT GIVES US THE COMFORT THAT WE SHOULD LOOK FORWARD TO THE JUDGMENT WHEN THE GOD LESS WILL BE JUDGED AND PASS AWAY. THE EARTH AND ALL ITS INHABITANTS WILL SHAKE AND TREMBLE NEVERTHELESS GOD WILL PRESERVE THE PILLARS, THAT IS, THE GODLY WHO BEAR AND PRESERVE THIS WORLD, AS ST. PAUL (1 TIMOTHY 3:15) CALLS THE CHURCH A FOUNDATION AND A PILLAR OF TRUTH. THUS GOD PRESERVED LOT WHEN HE OVERTHREW SODOM, AND HE PRESERVED THE BELIEVING READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER JEWS WIIH THE APOSTLES WHEN HE DESTROYED THE JEWISH NATION. FOR HE WELL KNOWS HOW TO DELIVER HIS OWN WHEN HE DESTROYS A LAND. Z& 1 WE GIVE THANKS TO YOU, O GOD WE GIVE THANKS, FOR YOUR I NAME IS NEAR. WE RECOUNT YOUR I WONDROUS DEEDS. 2 AT THE SET TIME THAT I I APPOINT 1 WILL JUDGE WITH I EQUITY. 3 WHEN THE EARTH TOTTERS, AND ALL ITS IN-1 HABITANTS, IT IS I WHO KEEP STEADY ITS I PILLARS. 4 1 SAY TO THE BOASTFUL, I DO NOT BOAST, AND TO THE WICKED, DO NOT LIFT I UP YOUR HORN 5 DO NOT LIFT UP YOUR I HORN ON HIGH, OR SPEAK WITH I HAUGHTY NECK. " 6 FOR NOT FROM THE EAST OR I FROM THE WEST AND NOT FROM THE WILDERNESS COMES I LIFTING UP. 7 BUT IT IS GOD WHO EXECUTES I JUDGMENT, PUTTING DOWN ONE AND LIFTING UP AN-1 OTHER. 8 FOR IN THE HAND OF THE LORD THERE IS A CUP WITH FOAMING WINE, WELL MIXED, AND HE POURS I OUT FROM IT, AND ALL THE WICKED OF THE EARTH I SHALL DRAIN IT DOWN I TO THE DREGS. 9 BUT I WILL DECLARE IT FOR- I EVER I WILL SING PRAISES TO THE GOD OF I JACOB. 10 ALL THE HORNS OF THE WICKED I WILL I CUT OFF, BUT THE HORNS OF THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL BE I LIFTED UP. PSALM 76 PRA YER O GOD, LET US HEAR WHEN OUR SHEPHERD SHALL CALL IN ACCENTS PERSUASIVE AND TENDER. THAT WHILE THERE IS TIME WE MAKE HASTE, ONE AND ALL. AND FIND HIM, OUR MIGHTY DEFENDER. HAVE MERCY UPON US, O JESUS! ALL TRIALS SHALL BE LIKE A DREAMS THAT IS PAST, FORGOTTEN ALL TROUBLE AND MOURNING. ALL QUESTIONS AND DOUBTS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED AT LAST. WHEN RISES THE LIGHT OF THAT MORNING. HAVE MERCY UPON US, O JESUS! AMEN, USB SIO 2 . PSALM 76 HE 76TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS, SIMILAR TO THE 46LH PSALM. FOR IT GIVES THANKS THAT GOD HAS HIS DWELLING. WORD, AND WORSHIP IN JERUSALEM AND THAT HE MAGNIFICENTLY PROTECTS HIS PEOPLE FROM BEING DEVOURED BY THE KINGS AND THE RAGE OF WARRIORS SUCH AS SENNACHERIB. GOD KNEW' HOW TO TAKE COURAGE AWAY FROM PRINCES AND MAKE THEM DISCOUR AGED. IN THE SAME WAY HE FIGHTS AGAINST OUR ENEMIES. AS STRONG AND AS EVIL AS THEY MAY BE, IT IS HARD TO DEFEND THEM SELVES AGAINST GOD, WHO TAKES AWAY AT ONCE THEIR HEART AND COURAGE. EVEN THE DEVIL FLEES WHEN HIS COURAGE FAILS HIM. WHAT THEN CAN FLESH AND BLOOD DO? SUCH A WARRIOR-GOD MUST BE PRAISED, WHO DEALS THUS WITH THE NOISE OF KINGS. HE CAN SAVE HIS OWN WITHOUT A SWORD, BY FRIGHT AND FEAR ALONE. |79 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER ?6 1 IN JUDAH I GOD IS KNOWN 4  HIS NAME IS GREAT IN I ISRAEL. 2 HIS ABODE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN I SALEM, HIS DWELLING PLACE IN I ZION. J THERE HE BROKE THE HASHING I ARROWS| THE SHIELD, THE SWORD, AND THE WEAP-1 ONS OF WAR. 4 GLORIOUS ARE YOU, MORE MA-1 JESTIC  THAN THE MOUN-1 TAINS OF PREY. 5 THE STOUTHEARTED WERE STRIPPED OF THEIR SPOIL THEY SANK I INTO SLEEP ALL THE MEN OF WAR WERE UNABLE TO I USE THEIR HANDS. 6 AT YOUR REBUKE, O GOD OF I JACOB, BOTH RIDER AND I HORSE LAY STUNNED. 7 BUT YOU, YOU ARE I TO BE FEARED! WHO CAN STAND BEFORE YOU WHEN ONCE YOUR AN-1 GER IS ROUSED? 8 FROM THE HEAVENS YOU UTTERED I JUDGMENT THE EARTH FEARED I AND WAS STILL, 9 WHEN GOD AROSE TO ESTABLISH I JUDGMENT, TO SAVE ALL THE HUMBLE I OF THE EARTH. 10 SURELY THE WRATH OF MAN SHALL! PRAISE YOU THE REMNANT OF WRATH YOU WILL PUT ON I LIKE A BELT. 11 MAKE YOUR VOWS TO THE LORD YOUR GOD AND PER-1 FORM THEM LET ALL AROUND HIM BRING GIFTS TO HIM WHO IS I TO BE FEARED, 12 WHO CUTS OFF THE SPIRIT OF I PRINCES, WHO IS TO BE FEARED BY THE KINGS I OF THE EARTH. 80 PSALM 77 HR A YER THANKS TO YOU, LORD JESUS, FOR PLANTING YOUR GOSPEL AT THIS PLACE, AND GATHERING A CHURCH THAT CONTINUES IN YOUR WORD. DRIVE FAR FROM US THE INDIFFERENCE AND APATHY OF THESE LATTER EVIL DAYS. CAUSE OUR HEARTS TO BUM WITH ZEAL FOR THE TRUTH OF YOUR WORD, AND PRESERVE YOUR DOCTRINE TRUE AT THIS PLACE, THAT OUR CHILDREN AFTER US MAY BE STILL PRAISING YOU. AMEN. PSALM 77 E 77TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION. THE PSALMIST USES HIMSELF AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO FIND COMFORT WHEN AFFLICTION COMES AND THE CONSCIENCE IS TROUBLED, AS IF GOD IS ANGRY WITH IT. HE SAYS THAT HE WAS SO TROUBLED THAT HE COULD NOT HAVE ANY SLEEP OR EVEN SPEAK. BUT THIS COMFORT FOLLOWS: THE PSALMIST CAN FIGHT OFF THE THOUGHTS WITH WHICH HE FUTILELY SUFFERED, AND HE CAN GRASP INSTEAD THE THOUGHT OF THE MIGHTY WORKS OF GOD IN THE HISTORIES OF OLD. HERE WE FIND THAT GODS WORK WAS TO HELP THE MISERABLE, THE TROU BLED, AND THE ABANDONED, AND TO THROW DOWN THE SELF-SECURE, PROUD SCOFFER, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN HE DELIVERED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL FROM EGYPT. FOR THIS REASON HIS PATHS ARE CALLED HIDDEN. HE IS THERE TO HELP WHEN WE THINK THAT WE ARE TOTALLY ABANDONED. WE SHOULD LEARN THIS WELL. GOD INTENDS BY THIS PSALM TO SHOW US AND TEACH US HIS MANNER OF HELPING, NAMELY THAT HE NEVER ABANDONS US WHEN THINGS GO ILL. INSTEAD, WE SHOULD WAIT UPON HIS HELP AT THAT TIME WITH THE GREATEST CONFIDENCE AND NOT BELIEVE OUR THOUGHTS. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 77 1 I CRY A-1 LOUD TO GOD, ALOUD TO GOD, AND HE WILL I HEAR ME. 2 IN THE DAY OF MY TROUBLE 11 SEEK THE LORD IN THE NIGHT MY HAND IS STRETCHED OUT WITHOUT WEARYING MY SOUL REFUSES TO BE I COMFORTED. 3 WHEN I REMEMBER I GOD, I MOAN WHEN I MEDITATE, MY I SPIRIT FAINTS. 4 YOU HOLD MY EYELIDS I OPEN I AM SO TROUBLED THAT 11 CANNOT SPEAK. 5 I CONSIDER THE I DAYS OF OLD, THE YEARS I LONG AGO. 6 1 SAID, LET ME REMEMBER MY SONG IN THE NIGHT LET ME MEDITATE I IN MY HEART. THEN MY SPIRIT MADE A DIL-1 IGENT SEARCH: I WILL THE LORD SPURN FOR-1 EVER, AND NEVER AGAIN BE I FAVORABLE? 8 HAS HIS STEADFAST LOVE FOR-1 EVER CEASED? ARE HIS PROMISES AT AN END I FOR ALL TIME? 9 HAS GOD FORGOTTEN TO BE I GRACIOUS? HAS HE IN ANGER SHUT UP HIS COM-1 PASSION? 10 THEN I SAID, I WILL AP-1 PEAL TO THIS, TO THE YEARS OF THE RIGHT HAND OF THE I MOST HIGH. II I WILL REMEMBER THE DEEDS 1 OF THE LORD YES, I WILL REMEMBER YOUR WON-1 DERS OF OLD. 12 1 WILL PONDER I ALL YOUR WORK, AND MEDITATE ON YOUR I MIGHTY DEEDS. 33 YOUR WAY, O GOD, IS I HOLY. WHAT GOD IS GREAT I LIKE OUR GOD? 14 YOU ARE THE GOD WHO WORKS I WONDERS YOU HAVE MADE KNOWN YOUR MIGHT AMONG THE I PEOPLES. PSALM 77 5 YOU WITH YOUR ARM REDEEMED YOUR 1 PEOPLE, THE CHILDREN OF JACOB AND I JOSEPH. 16 WHEN THE WATERS SAW YOU, O GOD, WHEN THE WATERS SAW YOU, THEY I WERE AFRAID INDEED, THE DEEP I TREMBLED. 17 THE CLOUDS POURED OUT WATER THE SKIES GAVE FORTH I THUNDER YOUR ARROWS FLASHED ON I EVERY SIDE. 18 THE CRASH OF YOUR THUNDER WAS IN THE WHIRLWIND YOUR LIGHTNINGS LIGHTED I UP THE WORLD THE EARTH TREM- I BLED AND SHOOK. 19 YOUR WAY WAS THROUGH THE SEA, YOUR PATH THROUGH THE GREAT I WATERS YET YOUR FOOTPRINTS I WERE UNSEEN. 20 YOU LED YOUR PEOPLE I LIKE A FLOCK BY THE HAND OF MOSES AND I AARON. PRAYER GOD OF ALL COMFORT, THE FATHER OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, GRANT THE CONSOLATIONS OF YOUR HOLY SPIRIT TO ALL COMFORTLESS AND AFFLICTED SOULS. MAKE US TO BE ROOTED AND GROUNDED IN FAITH, ARMED WITH THE BREASTPLATE OF CHRISTS RIGHTEOUSNESS, FURNISHED WITH THE HELMET OF AN UNWAVERING HOPE, AND PRO VIDED WITH THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT, THE WORD OF TRUTH, BY WHICH WE SHALL TRIUMPH OVER ALL ENEMIES. AMEN. RHADING THH PSAL MS WITH LL'IHHR LSAI M 7H HE 78TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION. USING THE EXAMPLE AND HISTORY OF THE ENTIRE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL FROM THE BEGINNING UNTIL DAVID, IT LEACHES US TO TRUST AND TO BELIEVE IN GOD, AND IT WARNS US AGAINST MISTRUST AND FAITHLESSNESS. THE PSALM DECLARES THE PUNISHMENT THAT FOLLOWS FAITHLESSNESS AND THE GRACE THAT COMES WITH TRUST. 7 ?  GIVE EAR, O MY PEOPLE, TO MY I TEACHING' INCLINE YOUR EARS TO THE WORDS I OF MY MOUTH! 2 1 WILL OPEN MY MOUTH IN A I PARABLE I WILL UTTER DARK SAYINGS I FROM OF OLD, 3 THINGS THAT WE HAVE I HEARD AND KNOWN, " THAT OUR FATHERS HAVE I TOLD US. 4 WE WILL NOT HIDE THEM FROM THEIR CHILDREN, BUT TELL TO THE COMING GENERATION THE GLORIOUS DEEDS OF THE LORD, I AND HIS MIGHT, AND THE WONDERS THAT I HE HAS DONE. 5 HE ESTABLISHED A TESTIMONY IN JACOB AND APPOINTED A LAW IN I ISRAEL, WHICH HE COMMANDED OUR FATHERS TO TEACH TO THEIR I CHILDREN, 6 THAT THE NEXT GENERATION MIGHT KNOW THEM, THE CHILDREN I YET UNBORN, AND ARISE AND TELL THEM TO THEIR I CHILDREN, 7 SO THAT THEY SHOULD SET THEIR I HOPE IN GOD AND NOT FORGET THE WORKS OF GOD, BUT KEEP HIS COM-1 MANDMENTS |? PSALM 78 8 AND THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE LIKE THEIR FATHERS, A STUBBORN AND REBELLIOUS GENER-1 ATION, A GENERATION WHOSE HEART WAS NOT STEADFAST, WHOSE SPIRIT WAS NOT FAITH-! FUL TO GOD. 9 THE EPHRAIMITES, ARMED I WITH THE BOW, TURNED BACK ON THE DAY OF I BATTLE. 10 THEY DID NOT KEEP GODS I COVENANT, BUT REFUSED TO WALK ACCORDING I TO HIS LAW. 11 THEY FOR-1 GOT HIS WORKS AND THE WONDERS THAT HE HAD I SHOWN THEM. 12 IN THE SIGHT OF THEIR FATHERS HE PERFORMED I WONDERS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT, IN THE I FIELDS OF ZOAN. 13 HE DIVIDED THE SEA AND LET THEM I PASS THROUGH IT, AND MADE THE WATERS STAND I LIKE A HEAP. 14 IN THE DAYTIME HE LED THEM I WITH A CLOUD, AND ALL THE NIGHT WITH A I FIERY LIGHT. 15 HE SPLIT ROCKS IN THE I WILDERNESS AND GAVE THEM DRINK ABUNDANTLY AS I FROM THE DEEP. 16 HE MADE STREAMS COME OUT I OF THE ROCK AND CAUSED WATERS TO FLOW DOWN LIKE I RIVERS. 17 YET THEY SINNED STILL MORE A-1 GAINST HIM, REBELLING AGAINST THE MOST HIGH IN THE I DESERT. 18 THEY TESTED GOD I IN THEIR HEART BY DEMANDING THE I FOOD THEY CRAVED. 19 THEY SPOKE AGAINST GOD, I SAYING, CAN GOD SPREAD A TABLE IN THE I WILDERNESS? 20 HE STRUCK THE ROCK SO THAT WATER GUSHED OUT AND STREAMS I OVERFLOWED. CAN HE ALSO GIVE BREAD OR PROVIDE MEAT FOR HIS I PEOPLE? 21 THEREFORE, WHEN THE LORD HEARD, HE WAS FULL OF WRATH A FIRE WAS KINDLED AGAINST I JACOB HIS ANGER ROSE AGAINST I ISRAEL, A9S READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 22 BECAUSE THEY DID NOT BE-1 LIEVE IN GOD AND DID NOT TRUST HIS I SAVING POWER. 23 YET HE COMMANDED THE I SKIES ABOVE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF I HEAVEN, 24 AND HE RAINED DOWN ON THEM MAN-1 NA TO EAT AND GAVE THEM THE GRAIN OF I HEAVEN. PRAYER HEAVENLY DOVE, SPIRIT DIVINE, FILL OUR HEARTS WITH THE LOVE OF YOUR WORD, AND THROUGH IT CREATE IN US THE SAVING KNOWLEDGE OF JESUS CHRIST. ENDOW ALL PARENTS WITH WISDOM TO REAR THEIR CHILDREN IN THE FEAR OF GOD, AND BLESS ALL OUR CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS, THAT THESE FOLDS FOR JESUS LAMBS MAY PROSPER AND MULTIPLY IN OUR LAND. AMEN. 25 MAN ATE OF THE BREAD OF THE I ANGELS HE SENT THEM FOOD IN A-1 BUNDANCE. 26 HE CAUSED THE EAST WIND TO BLOW IN THE I HEAVENS, AND BY HIS POWER HE LED OUT THE I SOUTH WIND 27 HE RAINED MEAT ON I THEM LIKE DUST, WINGED BIRDS LIKE THE SAND I OF THE SEAS 28 HE LET THEM FALL IN THE MIDST I OF THEIR CAMP, ALL AROUND THEIR I DWELLINGS. 29 AND THEY ATE AND WERE I WELL FILLED, FOR HE GAVE THEM I WHAT THEY CRAVED. 30 BUT BEFORE THEY HAD SATISFIED THEIR I CRAVING, WHILE THE FOOD WAS STILL I IN THEIR MOUTHS, 31 THE ANGER OF GOD ROSE AGAINST THEM, AND HE KILLED THE STRONG-1 EST OF THEM AND LAID LOW THE YOUNG MEN OF I ISRAEL. 32 IN SPITE OF ALL THIS, I THEY STILL SINNED DESPITE HIS WONDERS, THEY DID I NOT BELIEVE. S&6 PSALM 78 33 SO HE MADE THEIR DAYS VANISH I LIKE A BREATH, AND THEIR YEARS IN I TERROR. 34 WHEN HE KILLED THEM, THEY I SOUGHT HIM THEY REPENTED AND SOUGHT GOD I EARNESTLY. 35 THEY REMEMBERED THAT GOD I WAS THEIR ROCK, THE MOST HIGH GOD THEIR RE-1 DEEMER. 36 BUT THEY FLATTERED HIM I WITH THEIR MOUTHS THEY LIED TO HIM I WITH THEIR TONGUES. 37 THEIR HEART WAS NOT STEADFAST I TOWARD HIM THEY WERE NOT FAITHFUL TO HIS I COVENANT. 38 YET HE, BEING COMPASSIONATE, ATONED FOR THEIR INIQUITY AND DID NOT DE-1 STROY THEM HE RESTRAINED HIS ANGER OFTEN AND DID NOT STIR UP I ALL HIS WRATH. 39 HE REMEMBERED THAT THEY I WERE BUT FLESH, A WIND THAT PASSES AND COMES I NOT AGAIN. 40 HOW OFTEN THEY REBELLED AGAINST HIM IN THE I WILDERNESS AND GRIEVED HIM IN THE I DESERT! 41 THEY TESTED GOD AGAIN I AND AGAIN AND PROVOKED THE HOLY ONE OF I ISRAEL. 42 THEY DID NOT REMEM-1 BER HIS POWER OR THE DAY WHEN HE REDEEMED THEM I FROM THE FOE, 43 WHEN HE PERFORMED HIS SIGNS IN I EGYPT AND HIS MARVELS IN THE I FIELDS OF ZOAN. 44 HE TURNED THEIR RIV-1 ERS TO BLOOD, SO THAT THEY COULD NOT DRINK I OF THEIR STREAMS. 45 HE SENT AMONG THEM SWARMS OF FLIES, WHICH DE-1 VOURED THEM, AND FROGS, WHICH DE-1 STROYED THEM. 46 HE GAVE THEIR CROPS TO THE DESTROYING I LOCUST AND THE FRUIT OF THEIR LABOR TO THE I LOCUST. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 47 HE DESTROYED THEIR I VINES WITH HAIL AND THEIR SYCA-1 MORES WITH FROST. 48 HE GAVE OVER THEIR CATTLE I TO THE HAIL AND THEIR FLOCKS TO I THUNDERBOLTS. 49 HE LET LOOSE ON THEM HIS BURNING ANGER, WRATH, INDIGNATION, I AND DISTRESS, A COMPANY OF DESTROYING I ANGELS. 50 HE MADE A PATH FOR HIS I ANGER HE DID NOT SPARE THEM FROM DEATH, BUT GAVE THEIR LIVES OVER I TO THE PLAGUE. 51 HE STRUCK DOWN EVERY FIRSTBORN IN I EGYPT, THE FIRSTFRUITS OF THEIR STRENGTH IN THE I TENTS OF HAM. 52 THEN HE LED OUT HIS PEOPLE I LIKE SHEEP AND GUIDED THEM IN THE WILDERNESS I LIKE A FLOCK. PRAYER OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN, YOU ARE A FATHER INDEED, MERCIFUL, GOOD, AND KIND. TEACH US TO KNOW AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU AS THE GIVER OF EVERY GOOD GIFT. DO NOT DEAL WITH US AFTER OUR INGRATITUDE AND APATHY, BUT CHASTEN US WITH MEASURE, SO AS TO KEEP US IN THE WAY EVERLASTING. AMEN. 53 HE LED THEM IN SAFETY, SO THAT THEY WERE 1 NOT AFRAID, BUT THE SEA OVERWHELMED THEIR I ENEMIES. 54 AND HE BROUGHT THEM TO HIS I HOLY LAND, TO THE MOUNTAIN WHICH HIS RIGHT I HAND HAD WON. 55 HE DROVE OUT NATIONS BE-1 FORE THEM HE APPORTIONED THEM FOR A POSSESSION AND SETTLED THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL I IN THEIR TENTS. 56 YET THEY TESTED AND REBELLED AGAINST THE I MOST HIGH GOD AND DID NOT KEEP HIS TESTI-1 MONIES. |&? PSALM 78 57 BUT TURNED AWAY AND ACTED TREACHEROUSLY LIKE THEIR I FATHERS THEY TWISTED LIKE A DE-1 CEITFUL BOW. 5 FOR THEY PROVOKED HIM TO ANGER WITH THEIR HIGH I PLACES THEY MOVED HIM TO JEALOUSY WITH THEIR I IDOLS. 59 WHEN GOD HEARD, HE WAS I FULL OF WRATH, AND HE UTTERLY REJECTED I ISRAEL. 60 HE FORSOOK HIS DWELLING AT 1 SHILOH, THE LENT WHERE HE DWELT A-1 MONG MANKIND, 61 AND DELIVERED HIS POWER TO CAP-1 TIVITY, HIS GLORY TO THE HAND I OF THE FOE. 62 HE GAVE HIS PEOPLE OVER! TO THE SWORD AND VENTED HIS WRATH ON HIS I HERITAGE. 63 FIRE DEVOURED THEIR I YOUNG MEN, AND THEIR YOUNG WOMEN HAD NO ! MARRIAGE SONG. 64 THEIR PRIESTS FELL I BY THE SWORD, AND THEIR WIDOWS MADE NO LAMEN-1 TATION. 65 THEN THE LORD AWOKE I AS FROM SLEEP, LIKE A STRONG MAN SHOUTING BE-1 CAUSE OF WINE. 66 AND HE PUT HIS ADVERSARIES I TO ROUT HE PUT THEM TO EVER-1 LASTING SHAME. 67 HE REJECTED THE TENT OF I JOSEPH HE DID NOT CHOOSE THE TRIBE OF I EPHRAIM, 68 BUT HE CHOSE THE TRIBE OF I JUDAH, MOUNT ZION, I WHICH HE LOVES. 69 HE BUILT HIS SANCTUARY LIKE THE HIGH I HEAVENS, LIKE THE EARTH, WHICH HE HAS FOUNDED FOR-1 EVER. 70 HE CHOSE DAVID HIS SERVANT AND TOOK HIM FROM THE I SHEEPFOLDS 71 FROM FOLLOWING THE NURSING EWES HE BROUGHT HIM TO SHEPHERD JACOB HIS PEOPLE, ISRAEL HIS IN-1 HERITANCE. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 72 WITH UPRIGHT HEART HE SHEP-1 HERDED THEM AND GUIDED THEM WITH HIS I SKILLFUL HAND. PRAYER THANKS BE TO YOU, O LORD, FOR YOUR MANIFOLD BLESSINGS IN TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL THINGS. PUNISH US NOT AS WE DESERVE, BUT CHASTEN US WITH THE ROD OF A FATHER, AND REMEMBER THAT YOUR SON, JESUS CHRIST, DID ENDURE THE PUNISHMENT DUE TO OUR TRANSGRESSIONS. FOR HIS SAKE BLOT OUT OUR INIQUITIES, AND ACCOUNT THEM TO US NO MORE, BUT GRANT OUR EYES TO SEE YOUR SALVATION. AMEN. PSALM 79 R HE 79TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER AGAINST THE DESTRUCTION TO COME, WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE BABYLONIANS AND BY ANTIOCHUS EPHIPHANES. IT IS LIKE THE 78TH PSALM, SO THE SAME SUMMARY APPLIES. ISAIAH 63 ALSO PRAYS CONCERNING THIS COMING DESTRUCTION. 79 1 O GOD, THE NATIONS HAVE COME INTO YOUR INHERITANCE THEY HAVE DEFILED YOUR HOLY I TEMPLE THEY HAVE LAID JERUSALEM IN I RUINS. 2 THEY HAVE GIVEN THE BODIES OF YOUR SERVANTS TO THE BIRDS OF THE HEAV-1 ENS FOR FOOD, THE FLESH OF YOUR FAITHFUL TO THE BEASTS I OF THE EARTH. 3 THEY HAVE POURED OUT THEIR BLOOD LIKE WATER ALL AROUND JE-1 RUSALEM, AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO I BURY THEM. |90 PSALM 79 4 WE HAVE BECOME A TAUNT TO OUR I NEIGHBORS, MOCKED AND DERIDED BY THOSE A-1 ROUND US. 5 HOW LONG, O LORD? WILL YOU BE ANGRY FOR-1 EVER?

WHY SHOULD THE NATIONS SAY, WHERE I IS THEIR GOD? LET THE AVENGING OF THE OUTPOURED BLOOD OF YOUR SERVANTS BE KNOWN AMONG THE NATIONS BE-1 FORE OUR EYES! 11 LET THE GROANS OF THE PRISONERS COME BE-1 FORE YOU ACCORDING TO YOUR GREAT POWER, PRESERVE THOSE I DOOMED TO DIE! 12 RETURN SEVENFOLD INTO THE LAP OF OUR I NEIGHBORS THE TAUNTS WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TAUNTED YOU, I O LORD! 13 BUT WE YOUR PEOPLE, THE SHEEP OF YOUR PASTURE, WILL GIVE THANKS TO YOU FOR-1 EVER FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION WE WILL RE-1 COUNT YOUR PRAISE.

IT IS A SONG SUNG AND PREACHED IN THE HARVEST SEASON AT THE FESTIVAL OF TABERNACLES, CALLING THE PEOPLE BACK TO THE FIRST COM MANDMENT, THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE ONLY ONE GODHE WHO HAD BROUGHT THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPTAND SHOULD PRAISE AND CALL ON NO OTHER. THEY DID NOT KEEP THIS COM MAND, BUT INSTEAD THEIR MOUTH AND INSTRUCTION WERE FULL OF PSALM 81 IDOLATRY, WHEREAS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FULL OF THE TRUE GOD AND SHOULD HAVE ALWAYS SPOKEN OF HIM ALONE. THIS PSALM TEACHES US TO BELIEVE IN CHRIST AND CLING TO HIM ALONE AND NEVER COMMEND ANY WORK AS RIGHTEOUS BEFORE GOD. WE ALSO SHOULD HAVE OUR MOUTH FULL OF CHRIST, YET WE DO NOT DO THIS. EACH ONE FOLLOWS HIS OWN SELF-CONCEIT AND IDOL. |94 PSALM 81 9 | 1 SING ALOUD TO I GOD OUR STRENGTH SHOUT FOR JOY TO THE GOD OF I JACOB! 2 RAISE A SONG SOUND THE I TAMBOURINE, THE SWEET LYRE L WITH THE HARP. 3 BLOW THE TRUMPET AT THE I NEW MOON, AT THE FULL MOON, ON OUR I FEAST DAY. 4 FOR IT IS A STATUTE FOR I ISRAEL, A JUST DECREE OF THE GOD OF I JACOB. 5 HE MADE IT A DECREE IN JOSEPH WHEN HE WENT OUT OVER THE LAND OF I EGYPT. I HEAR A LANGUAGE I I HAD NOT KNOWN: 6 1 RELIEVED YOUR SHOULDER OF THE I BURDEN YOUR HANDS WERE FREED FROM THE I BASKET. 7 IN DISTRESS YOU CALLED, AND I DE- I LIVERED YOU I ANSWERED YOU IN THE SECRET PLACE OF THUNDER I TESTED YOU AT THE WATERS OF I MERIBAH. 8 HEAR, O MY PEOPLE, WHILE I AD- I MONISH YOU! O ISRAEL, IF YOU WOULD BUT LIS- I TEN TO ME! 9 THERE SHALL BE NO STRANGE GOD A- I MONG YOU YOU SHALL NOT BOW DOWN TO A I FOREIGN GOD. 10 I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD, WHO BROUGHT YOU UP OUT OF THE LAND OF I EGYPT.  OPEN YOUR MOUTH WIDE, AND I WILL I FILL IT. 11 "BUT MY PEOPLE DID NOT LISTEN I TO MY VOICE ISRAEL WOULD NOT SUB- I MIT TO ME. 12 SO I GAVE THEM OVER TO THEIR I STUBBORN HEARTS, TO FOLLOW THEIR OWN I COUNSELS. 13 OH, THAT MY PEOPLE WOULD LIS- I TEN TO ME, THAT ISRAEL WOULD WALK I IN MY WAYS! READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 14 1 WOULD SOON SUBDUE THEIR I ENEMIES AND TURN MY HAND A-1 GAINST THEIR FOES. 15 THOSE WHO HATE THE LORD WOULD I CRINGE TOWARD HIM, AND THEIR FATE WOULD LAST FOR-1 EVER. 16 BUT HE WOULD FEED YOU WITH THE FINEST I OF THE WHEAT, AND WITH HONEY FROM THE ROCK I WOULD SAT-1 ISFY YOU. PR AYER O LORD, GOD OF ALL GRACE, ANOINT US WITH THE OIL OF JOY, CAUSING YOUR HOLY SPIRIT TO DWELL IN OUR HEARTS, THAT HE MAY TEACH US TO WORSHIP YOU IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH. AND WHENEVER WE ENTER YOUR COURTS, LET IT BE DONE WITH A JOYOUS HEART, TO GIVE GLORY TO YOU, AND TO PRAISE YOUR HOLY NAME, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST, OUR LORD. AMEN. PSALM 82 R  |NE 82ND PSALM IS A PSALM OF COMFORT AGAINST THE TYRANTS WHO OPPRESS THOSE IN MISERY. BUT THIS PSALM HAS ALREADY HAD ITS INTERPRETATION, WHICH HAS LONG BEEN PUBLISHED. FROM LUTHERS COMMENTARY ON PSALM 82:2: AFTER THE GOSPEL OR THE MINISTRY, THERE IS ON EARTH NO BELTER JEWEL, NO GREATER TREASURE, NOR RICHER ALMS, NO FAIRER ENDOWMENT, NO FINER POSSESSION THAN A RULER WHO MAKES AND PRESERVES JUST LAWS. SUCH MEN ARE RIGHTLY CALLED GODS.... BUT WORLDLY GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE NO PROGRESS. THE PEOPLE ARE TOO WICKED, AND THE LORDS DISHONOR GODS NAME |96 PSALM 82 AND WORD CONTINUALLY BY THE SHAMEFUL ABUSE OF THEIR GOD HEAD. THEREFORE, HE PRAYS FOR ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AND KING DOM IN WHICH THINGS WILL BE BETTER, WHERE GODS NAME WILL BE HONORED, HIS WORD KEPT AND HE HIMSELF BE SERVED THAT IS THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST. . . . FOR CHRIST PRACTICES ARIGHT THE THREE DIVINE VIRTUES.... HE ADVANCES GODS WORD AND THE PREACHERS OF IT HE MAKES AND KEEPS LAW FOR THE POOR HE PROTECTS AND RESCUES THE MISER ABLE. THE SERVICE OF GOD IN CHRISTENDOM IS JUSTICE, PEACE, RIGHTEOUSNESS, LIFE, SALVATION. OF THIS KINGDOM OF CHRIST THE GOSPELS, AND THE EPISTLES OF THE APOSTLES, PREACH AND TESTIFY. LUTHER S WURK. U 54. 72 1 1 GOD HAS TAKEN HIS PLACE IN THE DIVINE I COUNCIL IN THE MIDST OF THE GODS HE HOLDS I JUDGMENT: 2 HOW LONG WILL YOU JUDGE UN- I JUSTLY AND SHOW PARTIALITY TO THE I WICKED? 3 GIVE JUSTICE TO THE WEAK AND THE I FATHERLESS MAINTAIN THE RIGHT OF THE AFFLICTED AND THE I DESTITUTE. 4 RESCUE THE WEAK AND THE I NEEDY DELIVER THEM FROM THE HAND OF THE I WICKED " 5 THEY HAVE NEITHER KNOWLEDGE NOR UNDERSTANDING, THEY WALK ABOUT IN I DARKNESS ALL THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH ARE I SHAKEN. 6 I SAID, I YOU ARE GODS. SONS OF THE MOST HIGH, I ALL OF YOU 7 NEVERTHELESS, LIKE MEN I YOU SHALL DIE, AND FALL LIKE I ANY PRINCE." 8 ARISE, O GOD, I JUDGE THE EARTH FOR YOU SHALL INHERIT ALL THE I NATIONS! |97 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PRA YER THANKS BE TO YOU, RULER OF NATIONS, BECAUSE YOU HAVE GRANTED OUR NATIVE LAND FREE INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT, UNDER WHICH WE ENJOY BOTH CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY. BY YOUR MIGHTY HAND PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS FREE REPUB LIC, AND SUFFER IT NOT TO BE OVERTHROWN BY REVOLUTIONS AND CIVIL WARS AND ALWAYS GRANT US HONEST AND WISE MEN FOR OFFICES HIGH AND LOW. AMEN. PSALM 83 HE 83RD PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER. IT IS MUCH THE SAME AS PSALM 80, WHICH CLEARLY SPELLS OUT THE NAMES OF THE GENTILE NATIONS THEREFORE, THE SAME SUMMARY APPLIES. 93 ' O GOD, DO NOT KEEP I SILENCE DO NOT HOLD YOUR PEACE OR BE STILL, I O GOD! 2 FOR BEHOLD, YOUR ENEMIES MAKE AN I UPROAR  THOSE WHO HATE YOU HAVE I RAISED THEIR HEADS. 3 THEY LAY CRAFTY PLANS AGAINST YOUR I PEOPLE THEY CONSULT TOGETHER AGAINST YOUR I TREASURED ONES. 4 THEY SAY, COME, LET US WIPE THEM OUT AS A I NATION LET THE NAME OF ISRAEL BE REMEMBERED I NO MORE! 5 FOR THEY CONSPIRE WITH 1 ONE ACCORD AGAINST YOU THEY MAKE A I COVENANT 6 THE TENTS OF EDOM AND THE I ISHMAELITES MOAB AND THE I HAGRITES, 7 GEBAL AND AMMON AND I AMALEK, PHIIISTIA WITH THE INHABI-1 TANTS OF TYRE |99 PSALM 83 8 ASSHUR ALSO HAS I JOINED THEM THEY ARE THE STRONG ARM OF THE CHIL-1 DREN OF LOT. 9 DO TO THEM AS YOU DID TO I MIDIAN AS TO SISERA AND JABIN AT THE RIVER I KISHON, 10 WHO WERE DESTROYED AT I ENDOR WHO BECAME DUNG I FOR THE GROUND. 11 MAKE THEIR NOBLES LIKE OR-1 EB AND ZEEB  ALL THEIR PRINCES LIKE ZEBAH AND I ZALMUNNA, 12 WHO SAID, LET US TAKE POSSESSION I FOR OURSELVES OF THE PASTURES I OF GOD. , OMY GOD, MAKE THEM LIKE I WHIRLING DUST, LIKE CHAFF BE-1 FORE THE WIND. A AS FIRE CONSUMES THE I FOREST  AS THE FLAME SETS THE MOUN-1 TAINS ABLAZE, 15 SO MAY YOU PURSUE THEM WITH YOUR I TEMPEST AND TERRIFY THEM WITH YOUR I HURRICANE! 16 FILL THEIR FAC-1 ES WITH SHAME THAT THEY MAY SEEK YOUR NAME, I O LORD. 17 LET THEM BE PUT TO SHAME AND DISMAYED FOR-1 EVER LET THEM PERISH I IN DISGRACE, 18 THAT THEY MAY KNOW THAT YOU ALONE, WHOSE NAME I IS THE LORD, ARE THE MOST HIGH OVER I ALL THE EARTH. PRAYER HOW OFTEN, O LORD OF HOSTS, HAVE YOU PROTECTED YOUR CHURCH AND PUT HER ENEMIES TO SHAME. GRANT US UNFLINCHING FAITH TO ABIDE IN YOUR WORD THAT WE YIELD NOT ONE JOT OR TITTLE OF YOUR TRUTH TO PLEASE MEN. CONTINUE TO BE OUR DEFENSE, EXPOSE THE SNARES WHICH THE HYPOCRITES ARTFULLY LAY FOR YOUR PEOPLE, HINDER THE PLANS OF YOUR ENEMIES, AND SHOW YOURSELF LORD OVER ALL, AS YOU HAVE DONE SO MANY TIMES OF OLD. AMEN. |99 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 84 R  |Z 84TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF COMFORT. IT PRAISES GODS WORD HIGHLY OVER ALL THINGS AND EXHORTS US TO GLADLY GIVE UP ALL GOOD THINGSGLORY, POWER, JOY, AND WHATEVER WE DESIRETHAT WE MAY HOLD ONTO GODS WORD. AND IF WE SHOULD BE LIKE THE DOORKEEPER, THAT IS, THE LEAST OF THOSE IN THE TEMPLE, THIS WOULD STILL BE FAR BETTER THAN TO SIT IN ALL THE CASTLES OF THE GODLESS. FOR GODS WORD (THE PSALMIST SAYS) GIVES VICTORY, SALVATION, GRACE, GLORY, AND ALL GOOD THINGS. OH, HOW BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE THIS AND THEN KEEP IT! BUT WHERE ARE THEY? EVEN IF THEY WERE SLANDERED AND DESPISED, THEY WOULD FIND THE WHOLE WORLD TO BE THEIRS IN ABUNDANCE, PREPARED FOR THEM. C 94 1 HOW LOVELY IS YOUR I DWELLING PLACE, O I LORD OF HOSTS! 2 MY SOUL LONGS, YES, FAINTS FOR THE COURTS I OF THE LORD MY HEART AND FLESH SING FOR JOY TO THE I LIVING GOD. 3 EVEN THE SPARROW FINDS A HOME, AND THE SWALLOW A NEST FOR HERSELF, WHERE SHE MAY I LAY HER YOUNG, AT YOUR ALTARS, O LORD OF HOSTS, MY KING I AND MY GOD. 4 BLESSED ARE THOSE WHO DWELL I IN YOUR HOUSE, EVER SING-1 ING YOUR PRAISE! 5 BLESSED ARE THOSE WHOSE STRENGTH IS I IN YOU, IN WHOSE HEART ARE THE HIGHWAYS TO I ZION. 6 AS THEY GO THROUGH THE VALLEY OF BACA THEY MAKE IT A I PLACE OF SPRINGS THE EARLY RAIN ALSO COVERS I IT WITH POOLS. 00 PSALM 84 7 THEY GO FROM I STRENGTH TO STRENGTH EACH ONE APPEARS BEFORE GOD IN I ZION. 8 O LORD GOD OF HOSTS, I HEAR MY PRAYER GIVE EAR, O GOD OF I JACOB! 9 BEHOLD OUR SHIELD, I O GOD LOOK ON THE FACE OF YOUR A-1 NOINTED! 10 FOR A DAY IN YOUR COURTS IS BETTER THAN A THOUSAND I ELSEWHERE. I WOULD RATHER BE A DOORKEEPER IN THE HOUSE OF MY GOD THAN DWELL IN THE TENTS OF I WICKEDNESS. 11 FOR THE LORD GOD IS A SUN AND SHIELD THE LORD BESTOWS FAVOR AND I HONOR. NO GOOD THING DOES HE WITHHOLD FROM THOSE WHO WALK UP- I RIGHTLY. 12 O I LORD OF HOSTS, BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO I TRUSTS IN YOU! PRAYER PRAISE AND THANKS TO YOU, LORD, OUR GOD, BECAUSE YOU HAVE GRANTED US YOUR WORD WHICH SHOWS US THE WAY OF SAL VATION. BY YOUR HOLY SPIRIT WORK EFFECTUALLY IN US THROUGH THIS YOUR WORD, THAT IT MAY PROVE IN US A LIVING AND FRUITFUL SEED BRINGING A HUNDREDFOLD, AND THAT THE FRUIT REMAIN TO ETERNAL LIFE. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER R 85TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER IN WHICH THE PSALMIST PLEADS AGAINST GODS WRATH AND SEEKS HIS GRACE. THE WRATH (IN MY OPINION) CONSISTS IN THIS, THAT THEY HAVE A LACK OF GODS WORD AND TRUE PREACHING ALSO A LACK OF GOOD GOVERNMENT, PEACE, AND GODLY AUTHORITY AND FINALLY A LACK OF FRUITFUL TIMES AND GOOD HARVEST. THESE AFFLICTIONS HANG TOGETHER, ONE WITH THE OTHER. THEREFORE, THE PSALMIST PRAYS THAT GOD WOULD SPEAK AGAIN, SO THAT HIS PEOPLE WILL NOT FALL INTO FOLLY, BLASPHEME IN IMPATIENCE, NOR SEEK OTHER GODS SO THAT PEACE, UNITY, TRUTH, AND LOVE MIGHT WASH OVER HIS PEO PLE, AND THAT THE LAND BE FRUITFUL SO THAT THEY CAN LIVE A PROP ER AND HONORABLE LIFE IN A GOD-PLEASING WAY IN PEACE AND QUIETNESS, AS ST. PAUL (1 TIMOTHY 2:2) ALSO TEACHES US TO PRAY. 1 LORD, YOU WERE FAVORABLE I TO YOUR LAND YOU RESTORED THE FORTUNES OF I JACOB. 2 YOU FORGAVE THE INIQUITY OF YOUR I PEOPLE YOU COVERED I ALL THEIR SIN. 3 YOU WITHDREW I ALL YOUR WRATH YOU TURNED FROM YOUR HOT I ANGER. 4 RESTORE US AGAIN, O GOD OF OUR SAL-1 VATION, AND PUT AWAY YOUR INDIGNATION I TOWARD US! 5 WILL YOU BE ANGRY WITH US FOR-1 EVER? WILL YOU PROLONG YOUR ANGER TO ALL GENER-1 ATIONS? 6 WILL YOU NOT REVIVE I US AGAIN THAT YOUR PEOPLE MAY RE-1 JOICE IN YOU? 7 SHOW US YOUR STEADFAST LOVE, I O LORD, AND GRANT US YOUR SAL-1 VATION. PSALM 85 8 LET ME HEAR WHAT GOD THE I LORD WILL SPEAK, FOR HE WILL SPEAK PEACE TO HIS PEOPLE, TO HIS SAINTS BUT LET THEM NOT TURN BACK TO I FOLLY. 9 SURELY HIS SALVATION IS NEAR TO THOSE WHO I FEAR HIM  THAT GLORY MAY DWELL I IN OUR LAND. 10 STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITH-1 FULNESS MEET RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PEACE KISS EACH I OTHER. 11 FAITHFULNESS SPRINGS UP I FROM THE GROUND AND RIGHTEOUSNESS LOOKS DOWN I FROM THE SKY. 12 YES, THE LORD WILL GIVE I WHAT IS GOOD, AND OUR LAND WILL YIELD ITS I INCREASE. 13 RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL GO BE-1 FORE HIM AND MAKE HIS FOOT-1 STEPS A WAY. PRAYER REMEMBER NOT, O GOD, OUR TRANSGRESSIONS AGAINST US, AND RECORD NOT OUR SINS IN YOUR BOOK, BUT CAST THEM INTO THE DEPTH OF THE SEA, AND REMEMBER THEM NO MORE FOREVER. IMPUTE TO US THE OBEDIENCE OF YOUR SON, JESUS CHRIST, WHO FULFILLED ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR US AND GAVE HIMSELF A SACRIFICE FOR OUR SINS. LET US LIVE FOR HIS SAKE, AND ENABLE US TO WALK WORTHY OF OUR CALLING. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER OR PSALM 86 R 86TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER. THE TITLE ITSELF CALLS IT A PRAYER OF DAVID. IT IS EASY AND CLEAR TO UNDER STAND. IN HIS DISTRESS, DAVID CALLS ON HIS GOD AGAINST HIS ENEMIES WHO SEEK TO PUT HIM TO DEATH, WHETHER THAT BE SAUL, ABSALOM, OR WHOEVER. BUT NOTICE HOW RICHLY AND MASTERFUL LY DAVID PRAISES GOD FOR HIS GOODNESS, FAITHFULNESS, AND POWER, SO THAT HE MAY TRULY EXCITE HIS OWN FAITH AND BRING WARMTH TO HIS PRAYER, AS WE SHOULD DO ALSO. THE SIGN HE DESIRES IS THAT GOD WOULD FINALLY HELP HIM SO THAT IT WOULD BE SAID: GOD HAS HELPED HIM AND TAKEN HIS SIDE AGAINST THE RAGE OF HIS ENEMIES, WHO HAVE VIOLATED GODS RULE. E 96 1 INCLINE YOUR EAR, O LORD, AND I ANSWER ME, FOR I AM POOR AND I NEEDY. 2 PRESERVE MY LIFE, FOR I AM I GODLY SAVE YOUR SERVANT, WHO TRUSTS IN YOU YOU I ARE MY GOD. 3 BE GRACIOUS TO ME, I O LORD, FOR TO YOU DO I CRY I ALL THE DAY. 4 GLADDEN THE SOUL OF YOUR I SERVANT, FOR TO YOU, O LORD, DO I LIFT I UP MY SOUL. 5 FOR YOU, O LORD, ARE GOOD AND FOR- I GIVING, ABOUNDING IN STEADFAST LOVE TO ALL WHO CALL UP- I ON YOU. 6 GIVE EAR, O LORD, I TO MY PRAYER LISTEN TO MY I PLEA FOR GRACE. 04 PSALM 86 7 IN THE DAY OF MY TROUBLE I CALL UP-1 ON YOU, FOR YOU I ANSWER ME. 8 THERE IS NONE LIKE YOU AMONG THE GODS, I O LORD, NOR ARE THERE ANY I WORKS LIKE YOURS. 9 ALL THE NATIONS YOU HAVE MADE SHALL COME AND WORSHIP BEFORE YOU, I O LORD, AND SHALL GLORI-1 FY YOUR NAME. 10 FOR YOU ARE GREAT AND DO I WONDROUS THINGS YOU A-1 LONE ARE GOD. 11 TEACH ME YOUR WAY, O LORD, THAT I MAY WALK I IN YOUR TRUTH UNITE MY HEART TO I FEAR YOUR NAME. 12 I GIVE THANKS TO YOU, O LORD MY GOD, WITH I MY WHOLE HEART, AND I WILL GLORIFY YOUR NAME FOR-1 EVER. 13 FOR GREAT IS YOUR STEADFAST I LOVE TOWARD ME YOU HAVE DELIVERED MY SOUL FROM THE DEPTHS I OF SHEOL. U O GOD, INSOLENT MEN HAVE RISEN UP AGAINST ME A BAND OF RUTHLESS MEN I SEEK MY LIFE, AND THEY DO NOT SET YOU BE-1 FORE THEM. 15 BUT YOU, O LORD, ARE A GOD MERCIFUL AND I GRACIOUS, SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN STEADFAST LOVE AND I FAITHFULNESS. 16 TURN TO ME AND BE GRA-1 CIOUS TO ME GIVE YOUR STRENGTH TO YOUR SERVANT, AND SAVE THE SON OF YOUR MAID-1 SERVANT. 17 SHOW ME A SIGN OF YOUR I FAVOR, THAT THOSE WHO HATE ME MAY SEE AND BE PUT TO SHAME BECAUSE YOU, LORD, HAVE HELPED ME AND COM-1 FORTED ME. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PR A YER O LORD ALMIGHTY, YOU ALONE ARE GOD, AND BESIDES YOU THERE IS NONE OTHER. HEAVEN IS YOUR THRONE AND THE EARTH YOUR FOOTSTOOL. BUT SEATED HIGH YOU LOOK UPON THE POOR AND LOWLY. REMEMBER THAT WE ARE DUST AND WITHOUT YOU CAN DO NOTHING, AND BE YOURSELF THE HELP OF OUR COUNTENANCE. REMOVE OUR SINS FROM US, AND SAVE US FROM THE HAND OF OUR ENEMIES, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST, OUR LORD. AMEN. PSALM 87 LE 87TH PSALM IS A PROPHECY OF THE HOLY CHRISTIAN CHURCH, THAT IT SHALL BE A CITY AS WIDE AS THE EARTH IS, AND IN IT SHALL BE BOM ETHIOPIANS, EGYPTIANS, BABYLONIANS, PHILISTINES, RESIDENTS OF TYRE, AND PEOPLES OF OTHER LANDS AND TONGUES. THIS SHALL ALL HAPPEN THROUGH THE GOSPEL, WHICH SHALL PREACH MARVELOUS THINGS OF GOD, NAMELY, THE KNOWL EDGE OF GOD, HOW ONE MAY COME TO GOD, BE FREED FROM SIN, AND BE SAVED FROM DEATH, THROUGH CHRIST. AND THE WORSHIP OF GOD IN THIS CITY SHALL ALSO BE SINGING AND DANCING, THAT IS, THEY WILL PROCLAIM, PRAISE, AND THANK GODS GRACE WITH JOY. IN THAT CITY, NO MOSES SHALL PLAGUE AND TORMENT US WITH HIS LAW. S? 1 ON THE HOLY MOUNT STANDS THE CITY HE I FOUNDED 2 THE LORD LOVES THE GATES OF ZION MORE THAN ALL THE DWELLING PLACES OF I JACOB. 3 GLORIOUS THINGS OF YOU ARE I SPOKEN, O CITY I OF GOD. 206 PSALM 88 4 AMONG THOSE WHO KNOW ME I MENTION RAHAB AND I BABYLON BEHOLD, PHILISTIA AND TYRE, WITH CUSH THIS ONE WAS BOM I THERE, THEY SAY. 5 AND OF ZION IT SHALL BE SAID, THIS ONE AND THAT ONE WERE I BOM IN HER FOR THE MOST HIGH HIMSELF WILL ES- I TABLISH HER. 6 THE LORD RECORDS AS HE REGISTERS THE I PEOPLES, THIS ONE WAS I BOM THERE  7 SINGERS AND DANCERS A- I LIKE SAY, "ALL MY SPRINGS I ARE IN YOU  PRAYER THANKS BE TO YOU, OUR HEAVENLY FATHER, BECAUSE YOU HAVE CALLED US INTO THE CHURCH OF YOUR SON, JESUS CHRIST, AND HAVE BEGOTTEN US AGAIN UNTO A LIVELY HOPE THROUGH THE GOSPEL. KEEP US STEADFAST IN THE FAITH, THAT WE MAY REMAIN LIVING STONES IN THIS YOUR SPIRITUAL TEMPLE TO OUR LAST DAY, AND CAUSE US ALWAYS TO REJOICE OVER YOUR SALVATION. AMEN. PSALM 88 IE 88TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER THAT PRAYS IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST AND ALL OTHER GREAT SAINTS, LAMENTING THE HIGH SPIRITUAL SUFFERING THAT IS ABOVE ALL SUFFERING, NAMELY, THE TERROR OF GOD. THIS IS WHAT THE PSALMIST CALLS DEATH, THE GRAVE, AND HELL, AS IT TRULY IS, CAUSING MISERABLE AND PITIFUL CONDITIONS. ST. PAUL CALLED IT THE MESSENGER OF SATAN (2 CORINTHIANS 12:7) THAT BEAT ON HIM WITH HIS FIST, AND A "THORN IN HIS BODY WITH WHICH HE WAS PIERCED (AS IN GREECE THEY SPEARED AN EVILDOER). IN LIKE MANNER, THE HEATHEN SLAN- 07 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER DER OUR LORD AND CALL HIM THE PIERCED ONE, WHILE THE JEWS CALL HIM THE ONE WHO WAS HUNG. IT IS THE INHERITANCE OF CHRIST AND HIS PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THIS RIDICULE AND TO SUFFER IN THE WORLD. THIS PSALM ALSO SAYS THAT THEIR FRIENDS AND REL ATIVES, WHO SHOULD CRY FOR THEM AND SUFFER WITH THEM, ARE INSTEAD FAR FROM THEM.  9  1 O LORD, GOD OF MY SAL-1 VATION I CRY OUT DAY AND NIGHT BE-1 FORE YOU. 2 LET MY PRAYER COME BE-1 FORE YOU INCLINE YOUR EAR I TO MY CRY! 3 FOR MY SOUL IS FULL OF I TROUBLES, AND MY LIFE DRAWS NEAR I TO SHEOL. 1 AM COUNTED AMONG THOSE WHO GO DOWN I TO THE PIT I AM A MAN WHO I HAS NO STRENGTH, S LIKE ONE SET LOOSE AMONG THE DEAD, LIKE THE SLAIN THAT LIE I IN THE GRAVE, LIKE THOSE WHOM YOU REMEMBER NO MORE, FOR THEY ARE CUT OFF I FROM YOUR HAND. 6 YOU HAVE PUT ME IN THE DEPTHS I OF THE PIT, IN THE REGIONS I DARK AND DEEP. 7 YOUR WRATH LIES HEAVY UP-1 ON ME. AND YOU OVERWHELM ME WITH I ALL YOUR WAVES. 8 YOU HAVE CAUSED MY COMPANIONS TO I SHUN ME YOU HAVE MADE ME A HOR-1 ROR TO THEM. I AM SHUT IN SO THAT 1 CANNOT ESCAPE 9 MY EYE GROWS DIM THROUGH I SORROW. EVERY DAY I CALL UPON YOU, O LORD I SPREAD OUT MY I HANDS TO YOU. PSALM 88 10 DO YOU WORK WONDERS I FOR THE DEAD? DO THE DEPARTED RISE UP TO I PRAISE YOU? 11 IS YOUR STEADFAST LOVE DECLARED I IN THE GRAVE| OR YOUR FAITHFULNESS IN I ABADDON? 12 ARE YOUR WONDERS KNOWN IN THE I DARKNESS, OR YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE LAND OF FOR- I GETFULNESS? 13 BUT I, O LORD, I CRY TO YOU IN THE MORNING MY PRAYER COMES BE- I FORE YOU. 14 O LORD, WHY DO YOU CAST MY I SOUL AWAY? WHY DO YOU HIDE YOUR I FACE FROM ME? 15 AFFLICTED AND CLOSE TO DEATH FROM MY I YOUTH UP, I SUFFER YOUR TERRORS I AM I HELPLESS. 16 YOUR WRATH HAS SWEPT I OVER ME YOUR DREADFUL ASSAULTS DE- I STROY ME. 17 THEY SURROUND ME LIKE A FLOOD I ALL DAY LONG THEY CLOSE IN ON ME TO- I GETHER. 18 YOU HAVE CAUSED MY BELOVED AND MY FRIEND TO I SHUN ME MY COMPANIONS HAVE BECOME I DARKNESS. PRAYER LORD JESUS, WHO ENDURED THE PANGS OF DEATH AND THE TOR MENTS OF HELL FOR OUR SAKES, BE WITH US AND SAVE US FROM THE SPIRIT OF DESPONDENCY WHICH WOULD DRIVE US TO DESPAIR, AND WOULD SWALLOW UP OUR SOUL. POUR OUT ABUNDANTLY UPON US THE SPIRIT OF JOY AND COMFORT, TO LIFT FROM US THE BURDEN AND GUILT OF SIN, AND TO STRENGTHEN AND COMFORT US THROUGH YOUR SACRED WOUNDS. AMEN. 09 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER D'NE 89TH PSALM IS A PROPHECY OF CHRIST AND HIS KINGDOM. THE PSALMIST CALLS IT A HEAVENLY KINGDOM (AS CHRIST HIMSELF DOES IN THE GOSPEL). IT TAKES UP THE PROPHE CY OF CHRIST GIVEN TO DAVID AND EMPHASIZES IT WITH AN ABUN DANT SPIRIT. PARTICULARLY, THE PSALMIST EMPHASIZES THAT THIS KINGDOM SHALL NEVER, FOR THE SAKE OF ANY SIN, COME TO AN END OR BE LEFT BEHIND. ACCORDINGLY, OUR SALVATION SHALL NOT BE BASED ON OUR PIETY, THOUGH THE PROMISED KINGDOM OF THE JEWS AND ALL OTHER EARTHLY KINGDOMS LAST NO LONGER OR STRETCH NO FARTHER THAN THEY ARE PIOUS. BUT LATER THE PSALMIST BEGINS TO PROPHESY THAT SUCH A PRECIOUS AND FRUITFUL KINGDOM WOULD BE TRAMPLED, TOM, AND SUBVERTED BY THE ANTICHRIST, SO THAT IT APPEARS AS THOUGH GOD HAS FORGOTTEN HIS FORMER ABUNDANT PROMISES AND IS DOING THE OPPOSITE OF HIS OWN WORDS. BUT THIS ALL IS ANNOUNCED BEFOREHAND, TO BE A COMFORT TO US IN THESE LAST DAYS. THEREFORE, WE SHOULD NOT DESPAIR, THOUGH IT SEEMS TO US THAT THERE IS NO CHRISTENDOM, NO LIGHT OF THE CHURCH, ANYMORE ON EARTH. YET IT ALWAYS REMAINS, HOWEVER DISTRESSED, BROKEN, AND PERSECUTED. 99 1 I WILL SING OF THE STEADFAST LOVE OF THE LORD, FOR-1 EVER WITH MY MOUTH I WILL MAKE KNOWN YOUR FAITHFULNESS TO ALL GENER-1 ATIONS. 2 FOR I SAID, STEADFAST LOVE WILL BE BUILT UP FOR-1 EVER IN THE HEAVENS YOU WILL ESTABLISH YOUR I FAITHFULNESS. 3 YOU HAVE SAID, 1 HAVE MADE A COVENANT WITH MY I CHOSEN ONE I HAVE SWORN TO DAVID MY I SERVANT: PSALM 89 4 I WILL ESTABLISH YOUR OFFSPRING FOR-1 EVER, AND BUILD YOUR THRONE FOR ALL GENER-1 ATIONS.  5 LET THE HEAVENS PRAISE YOUR WONDERS, I O LORD, YOUR FAITHFULNESS IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE I HOLY ONES! 6 FOR WHO IN THE SKIES CAN BE COMPARED I TO THE LORD? WHO AMONG THE HEAVENLY BEINGS IS I LIKE THE LORD, 7 A GOD GREATLY TO BE FEARED IN THE COUNCIL OF THE I HOLY ONES, AND AWESOME ABOVE ALL WHO ARE A-1 ROUND HIM? 8 O LORD GOD OF HOSTS, WHO IS MIGHTY AS YOU ARE, I O LORD  WITH YOUR FAITHFULNESS ALL A-1 ROUND YOU? 9 YOU RULE THE RAGING I OF THE SEA WHEN ITS WAVES RISE, YOU I STILL THEM. 10 YOU CRUSHED RAHAB LIKE A I CARCASS YOU SCATTERED YOUR ENEMIES WITH YOUR I MIGHTY ARM. 11 THE HEAVENS ARE YOURS THE EARTH AL-1 SO IS YOURS THE WORLD AND ALL THAT IS IN IT, YOU HAVE I FOUNDED THEM. 12 THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH, YOU HAVE ERE-1 ATED THEM TABOR AND HERMON JOYOUSLY I PRAISE YOUR NAME. 13 YOU HAVE A I MIGHTY ARM STRONG IS YOUR HAND, HIGH YOUR I RIGHT HAND. 14 RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE ARE THE FOUNDATION I OF YOUR THRONE STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS GO BE-1 FORE YOU. 15 BLESSED ARE THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE I FESTAL SHOUT, WHO WALK, O LORD, IN THE LIGHT I OF YOUR FACE, 16 WHO EXULT IN YOUR NAME I ALL THE DAY AND IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS ARE EX-1 ALTED. 17 FOR YOU ARE THE GLORY I OF THEIR STRENGTH BY YOUR FAVOR OUR HOM IS EX-1 ALTED. || READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 18 FOR OUR SHIELD BELONGS I TO THE LORD, OUR KING TO THE HOLY ONE OF I ISRAEL. PRAYER LORD JESUS, WE THANK YOU FOR CALLING US BY YOUR GOSPEL INTO YOUR KINGDOM OF GRACE. GRANT THAT WE BE MEMBERS NOT OF YOUR VISIBLE CHURCH ONLY, BUT OF THE INVISIBLE COMMUNITY OF SAINTS, LIVING TEMPLES OF YOUR SPIRIT. KEEP US STEADFAST IN THE TRUE FAITH, AND FINALLY RECEIVE US INTO YOUR KINGDOM OF ETERNAL GLORY. AMEN. 19 OF OLD YOU SPOKE IN A VISION TO YOUR GODLY ONE, AND SAID: I HAVE GRANTED HELP TO ONE WHO IS I MIGHTY I HAVE EXALTED ONE CHOSEN FROM THE I PEOPLE. 20 I HAVE FOUND DAVID, MY I SERVANT WITH MY HOLY OIL I HAVE A-1 NOINTED HIM, 21 SO THAT MY HAND SHALL BE ESTAB- I LISHED WITH HIM MY ARM ALSO SHALL I STRENGTHEN HIM. 22 THE ENEMY SHALL NOT OUT-1 WIT HIM THE WICKED SHALL NOT I HUMBLE HIM. 23 1 WILL CRUSH HIS FOES BE-1 FORE HIM AND STRIKE DOWN THOSE WHO I HATE HIM. 24 MY FAITHFULNESS AND MY STEADFAST LOVE SHALL I BE WITH HIM, AND IN MY NAME SHALL HIS HORN BE EX- I ALTED. 25 1 WILL SET HIS HAND I ON THE SEA AND HIS RIGHT HAND ON THE I RIVERS. 26 HE SHALL CRY TO ME, YOU ARE MY 1 FATHER, MY GOD, AND THE ROCK OF MY SAL-1 VATION. 27 AND I WILL MAKE HIM THE I FIRSTBORN, THE HIGHEST OF THE KINGS I OF THE EARTH. PSALM 89 2  MY STEADFAST LOVE I WILL KEEP FOR HIM FOR-1 EVER, AND MY COVENANT WILL STAND I FIRM FOR HIM. 29 I WILL ESTABLISH HIS OFFSPRING FOR-1 EVER AND HIS THRONE AS THE DAYS OF THE I HEAVENS. 30 IF HIS CHILDREN FOR-1 SAKE MY LAW AND DO NOT WALK ACCORDING TO MY I JUST DECREES, 31 IF THEY VIOLATE MY I STATUTES AND DO NOT KEEP MY COM-1 MANDMENTS, 32 THEN I WILL PUNISH THEIR TRANSGRESSION I WITH THE ROD AND THEIR INIQUI-1 TY WITH STRIPES, 33 BUT I WILL NOT REMOVE FROM HIM MY 1 STEADFAST LOVE OR BE FALSE TO MY I FAITHFULNESS. 3  I WILL NOT VIOLATE MY I COVENANT OR ALTER THE WORD THAT WENT FORTH I FROM MY LIPS. 35 ONCE FOR ALL I HAVE SWORN BY MY 1 HOLINESS I WILL NOT LIE TO I DAVID. 36 HIS OFFSPRING SHALL ENDURE FOR-1 EVER, HIS THRONE AS LONG AS THE SUN BE-1 FORE ME. 37 LIKE THE MOON IT SHALL BE ESTABLISHED FOR-1 EVER, A FAITHFUL WITNESS I IN THE SKIES. PRAYER WE GLORIFY YOU, O GOD, OUR MOST MERCIFUL FATHER IN HEAVEN, BECAUSE YOU HAVE GIVEN US A SAVIOR OF WHOM WE KNOW THAT HE IS ABLE TO SAVE EVEN THE GREATEST OF SINNERS, AND BECAUSE IN HIM YOU HAVE MADE A COVENANT THAT SHALL ENDURE FOREVER. BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO GRACIOUSLY RECEIVED US INTO THE COVENANT IN HOLY BAPTISM, GRANT US ALSO GRACE TO WALK THEREIN, AND TO REACH THE END OF FAITH, THE SALVATION OF THE SOUL. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 38 BUT NOW YOU HAVE CAST OFF AND RE-1 JECTED YOU ARE FULL OF WRATH AGAINST YOUR A-1 NOINTED. 39 YOU HAVE RENOUNCED THE COVENANT WITH YOUR I SERVANT YOU HAVE DEFILED HIS CROWN I IN THE DUST. 40 YOU HAVE BREACHED I ALL HIS WALLS YOU HAVE LAID HIS STRONGHOLDS IN I MINS. 41 ALL WHO PASS BY I PLUNDER HIM HE HAS BECOME THE SCOM OF HIS I NEIGHBORS. 42 YOU HAVE EXALTED THE RIGHT HAND I OF HIS FOES YOU HAVE MADE ALL HIS ENE-1 MIES REJOICE. 43 YOU HAVE ALSO TURNED BACK THE EDGE I OF HIS SWORD, AND YOU HAVE NOT MADE HIM STAND IN I BATTLE. 44 YOU HAVE MADE HIS SPLEN-1 DOR TO CEASE AND CAST HIS THRONE I TO THE GROUND. 45 YOU HAVE CUT SHORT THE DAYS I OF HIS YOUTH YOU HAVE COVERED I HIM WITH SHAME. 46 HOW LONG, O LORD? WILL YOU HIDE YOURSELF FOR-1 EVER? HOW LONG WILL YOUR WRATH I BUM LIKE FIRE? 47 REMEMBER HOW SHORT MY I TIME IS! FOR WHAT VANITY YOU HAVE CREATED ALL THE CHIL-1 DREN OF MAN! 48 WHAT MAN CAN LIVE AND NEVER I SEE DEATH? WHO CAN DELIVER HIS SOUL FROM THE POWER I OF SHEOL? 49 LORD, WHERE IS YOUR STEADFAST I LOVE OF OLD, WHICH BY YOUR FAITHFULNESS YOU SWORE TO I DAVID? 50 REMEMBER, O LORD, HOW YOUR SER-1 VANTS ARE MOCKED, AND HOW I BEAR IN MY HEART THE INSULTS OF ALL THE MANY I NATIONS, 51 WITH WHICH YOUR ENEMIES MOCK, I O LORD, WITH WHICH THEY MOCK THE FOOTSTEPS OF YOUR A-1 NOINTED. PSALM 90 52 BLESSED BE THE LORD FOR-1 EVER! AMEN AND I AMEN. PRAYER WONDERFULLY HAVE YOU, O GOD, PRESERVED YOUR CHURCH THROUGHOUT THE AGES ACCORDING TO YOUR PROMISE THAT THE GATES OF HELL SHOULD NOT PREVAIL AGAINST IT. IN MANY AND MIGHTY CONFLICTS AGAINST MANY AND MIGHTY ENEMIES YOU HAVE BEEN THE SALVATION OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE. GRANT US FAITH TO TRUST YOUR PROMISES, AND LET US NOT FALL FROM YOU FOR ANY EARTHLY AFFLIC TION OR IN THE PAINS OF DEATH, FOR JESUS CHRISTS SAKE. AMEN. R 90TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION IN WHICH MOSES TEACHES THE ORIGIN OF DEATH, NAMELY SIN, WHICH, THOUGH KNOWN ONLY BY GOD AND HIDDEN FROM THE WORLD, IS YET INBORN IN ALL FROM ADAM TO US. IT SHOWS THAT LIFE HERE IS NOT ONLY SHORT BUT ALSO MISERABLE, SO THAT IT MAY WELL BE CALLED A DAILY DEATH. NEVERTHELESS, THE PSALMIST SAYS THAT SUCH A LIFE IS GOOD, SO THAT THROUGH IT WE WOULD BE DRIVEN TO SEE GODS GRACE AND HIS HELP TO DELIVER US FROM IT ALL. FOR THOSE WHO NEVER THINK OF DEATH AND FEEL NO MISERY REMAIN SENSELESS FOOLS, CARING NOTHING FOR GODS GRACE OR HELP. THE PSALM ENDS WITH THE PRAYER THAT GOD WOULD SHOW US HIS WORK, NAMELY HIS DELIVERANCE FROM SIN AND DEATH, THAT IS, THAT HE WOULD SEND CHRIST. AND THE PSALMIST ASKS THAT, WHILE WE LIVE HERE, GOD WOULD ESTABLISH OUR WORK, THAT IS, THAT BOTH SPIRITUAL AND WORLDLY AUTHORITY MAY BE AND REMAIN FAVORABLE. THE 90TH PSALM IS A SHORT, FINE, RICH, AND FULL LIT TLE PRAYER. READING THE PSAI.MS WITH LUTHER 90 1 LORD, YOU HAVE BEEN OUR I DWELLING PLACE" IN ALL GENER-1 ATIONS. 2 BEFORE THE MOUNTAINS WERE BROUGHT FORTH, OR EVER HAD FORMED THE EARTH I AND THE WORLD, FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING I YOU ARE GOD. 3 YOU RETURN I MAN TO DUST" AND SAY, RETURN, O CHIL-1 DREN OF MAN!" 4 FOR A THOUSAND YEARS IN YOUR SIGHT ARE BUT AS YESTERDAY WHEN ! IT IS PAST," OR AS A WATCH I IN THE NIGHT. 5 YOU SWEEP THEM AWAY AS I WITH A FLOOD' THEY ARE LIKE A DREAM, LIKE GRASS THAT IS RENEWED IN THE I MORNING: 6 IN THE MORNING IT FLOURISHES AND I IS RENEWED IN THE EVENING IT FADES AND I WITHERS. 7 FOR WE ARE BROUGHT TO AN END BY YOUR I ANGER BY YOUR WRATH WE I ARE DISMAYED. 8 YOU HAVE SET OUR INIQUITIES BE-1 FORE YOU, OUR SECRET SINS IN THE LIGHT OF YOUR I PRESENCE. 9 FOR ALL OUR DAYS PASS AWAY UN-1 DER YOUR WRATH WE BRING OUR YEARS TO AN END I LIKE A SIGH. ,0 THE YEARS OF OUR LIFE ARE SEVENTY, OR EVEN BY REASON OF STRENGTH I EIGHTY YET THEIR SPAN IS BUT TOIL AND TROUBLE THEY ARE SOON GONE, AND WE I FLY AWAY. 11 WHO CONSIDERS THE POWER OF YOUR I ANGER, AND YOUR WRATH ACCORDING TO THE I FEAR OF YOU? 12 SO TEACH US TO NUMBER I OUR DAYS THAT WE MAY GET A HEART OF I WISDOM. 13 RETURN, O LORD!

AND FOR AS MANY YEARS AS WE HAVE SEEN I EVIL. 16 LET YOUR WORK BE SHOWN TO YOUR I SERVANTS, AND YOUR GLONOUS POWER TO THEIR I CHILDREN. 17 LET THE FAVOR OF THE LORD OUR GOD BE UPON US, AND ESTABLISH THE WORK OF OUR HANDS UP-1 ON US H YES, ESTABLISH THE WORK I OF OUR HANDS! PRAYER O LORD, ETERNAL GOD, TEACH US SO TO NUMBER OUR DAYS THAT WE MAY APPLY OUR HEARTS TO WISDOM, EMBRACING CHRIST AND HIS GOSPEL AS YOUR WISDOM AND YOUR COUNSEL FOR OUR SALVA TION. GRANT US GRACE TO WALK HONESTLY AS IN THE DAY THAT, WHEN OUR LAST HOUR IS COME, WE MAY BE FOUND IN TRUE FAITH AND GOD LINESS, READY TO APPEAR BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST. AMEN. PSALM 91 R HE 91ST PSALM IS A PSALM OF COMFORT THAT EXHORTS US TO TRUST IN GOD IN ALL DISTRESS AND AFFLICTION. IT IS FULL OF ABUNDANT PROMISES FLOWING FROM AND SPUN FROM THE FIRST COMMANDMENT. IT IS THE SECOND PSALM IN WHICH THE DEAR ANGELS ARE PROCLAIMED TO BE OUR GUARDS AND PROTECTORS (CF. PSALM 34), WHICH IS COMFORTING AND GOOD TO REMEMBER. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 9 | 1 HE WHO DWELLS IN THE SHELTER OF THE I MOST HIGH WILL ABIDE IN THE SHADOW OF THE AL-1 MIGHTY. 2 1 WILL SAY TO THE LORD, MY REFUGE AND MY I FORTRESS, MY GOD, IN I WHOM I TRUST. 3 FOR HE WILL DELIVER YOU FROM THE SNARE OF THE I FOWLER AND FROM THE DEADLY I PESTILENCE. 4 HE WILL COVER YOU WITH HIS PINIONS, AND UNDER HIS WINGS YOU WILL FIND I REFUGE HIS FAITHFULNESS IS A SHIELD AND I BUCKLER. 5 YOU WILL NOT FEAR THE TERROR I OF THE NIGHT, NOR THE ARROW THAT I FLIES BY DAY, 6 NOR THE PESTILENCE THAT STALKS IN I DARKNESS, NOR THE DESTRUCTION THAT WASTES AT I NOONDAY. 7 A THOUSAND MAY FALL AT YOUR SIDE, TEN THOUSAND AT YOUR I RIGHT HAND, BUT IT WILL NOT COME I NEAR YOU. 8 YOU WILL ONLY LOOK I WITH YOUR EYES AND SEE THE RECOMPENSE OF THE I WICKED. 9 BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE THE LORD YOUR I DWELLING PLACE THE MOST HIGH, WHO IS MY I REFUGE 10 NO EVIL SHALL BE ALLOWED TO BE-1 FALL YOU, NO PLAGUE COME I NEAR YOUR TENT. 11 FOR HE WILL COMMAND HIS ANGELS CON-1 CEMING YOU TO GUARD YOU IN I ALL YOUR WAYS. PSALM 91 12 ON THEIR HANDS THEY WILL I BEAR YOU UP, LEST YOU STRIKE YOUR FOOT A-1 GAINST A STONE. 13 YOU WILL TREAD ON THE LION AND THE I ADDER THE YOUNG LION AND THE SERPENT YOU WILL TRAMPLE I UNDERFOOT. I BECAUSE HE HOLDS FAST TO ME IN LOVE, 1 WILL DE-1 LIVER HIM 1 WILL PROTECT HIM, BECAUSE HE I KNOWS MY NAME. I3 WHEN HE CALLS TO ME, I WILL ANSWER HIM 1 WILL BE WITH HIM IN I TROUBLE I WILL RESCUE HIM AND I HONOR HIM. I WITH LONG LIFE I WILL SAT-1 ISFY HIM AND SHOW HIM MY SAL-1 VATION. PRAYER LORD JESUS CHRIST, THE AUTHOR AND FINISHER OF FAITH, GRANT US THE TRUE AND SAVING FAITH, AND PRESERVE US IN THE SAME AGAINST ALL TEMPTATIONS TO DOUBT AND UNBELIEF. BLOT OUT OUR INIQUITIES BY YOUR BLOOD COVER OUR SINS WITH YOUR RIGHTEOUS NESS, AND LET YOUR ANGELS BE A FENCED WALL AROUND US AGAINST ALL OUR ENEMIES, AND EVERMORE TEACH US TO KNOW THE SECRET OF YOUR FATHERS WILL. AMEN. |9 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER CHE 92ND PSALM IS A PSALM OF COMFORT THAT EXTOLS GOD S WORD AS THE MOST HIGHLY EXALTED AND PRECIOUS GIFT AGAINST THE FALSE SAINTS, WHOM IT ATTACKS. THEY CERTAINLY FLOWER FOR A LIME, GLORIOUS AND POWERFUL, BUT FINALLY THEY PERISH. HOWEVER, THE RIGHTEOUS WILL REMAIN FOREVER. ALTHOUGH THEY COME TO AN OLD AGE, THEY SHALL YET NEVER BE OLD, BUT THEY BECOME YOUNG DAILY THROUGH GODS WORD, WHICH ALWAYS CONVEYS FRUIT AND NEW GROWTH. BUT FOOLS NEI THER CONSIDER NOR UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS, AS WE ALSO SEE TODAY IN OUR OWN TIME. A? 1 IT IS GOOD TO GIVE THANKS I TO THE LORD, TO SING PRAISES TO YOUR NAME, I O MOST HIGH 2 TO DECLARE YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IN THE I MORNING, AND YOUR FAITHFUL-1 NESS BY NIGHT, 3 TO THE MUSIC OF THE LUTE I AND THE HARP, TO THE MELODY I OF THE LYRE. 4 FOR YOU, O LORD, HAVE MADE ME GLAD I BY YOUR WORK AT THE WORKS OF YOUR HANDS 11 SING FOR JOY. 5 HOW GREAT ARE YOUR WORKS, I O LORD! YOUR THOUGHTS ARE I VERY DEEP! 6 THE STUPID MAN CANNOT KNOW THE FOOL CANNOT UNDER-1 STAND THIS: 7 THAT THOUGH THE WICKED SPROUT LIKE GRASS AND ALL EVILDOERS FLOURISH, THEY ARE DOOMED TO DESTRUCTION FOR-1 EVER PSALM 92  BUT YOU, IO LORD, ARE ON HIGH FOR- I EVER. 9 FOR BEHOLD, YOUR ENEMIES, O LORD, FOR BEHOLD, YOUR ENEMIES SHALL I PERISH ALL EVILDOERS SHALL BE I SCATTERED. 10 BUT YOU HAVE EXALTED MY HORN LIKE THAT OF THE I WILD OX YOU HAVE POURED OVER ME I FRESH OIL. 11 MY EYES HAVE SEEN THE DOWNFALL OF MY I ENEMIES MY EARS HAVE HEARD THE DOOM OF MY EVIL AS-1 SAILANTS. 12 THE RIGHTEOUS FLOURISH LIKE THE I PALM TREE AND GROW LIKE A CEDAR IN I LEBANON. 13 THEY ARE PLANTED IN THE HOUSE I OF THE LORD THEY FLOURISH IN THE COURTS I OF OUR GOD. 14 THEY STILL BEAR FRUIT IN I OLD AGE THEY ARE EVER FULL OF I SAP AND GREEN, 15 TO DECLARE THAT THE LORD IS I UPRIGHT HE IS MY ROCK, AND THERE IS NO UNRIGHTEOUSNESS I IN HIM. PRAYER OH, THAT I HAD A THOUSAND VOICES TO PRAISE MY GOD WITH THOUSAND TONGUES! MY HEART, WHICH IN THE LORD REJOICES. THEN WOULD PROCLAIM IN GRATEFUL SONGS TO ALL, WHEREVER I MIGHT BE. WHAT GREAT THINGS GOD HAS DONE FOR ME. AMEN. (LSB:1) READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER R 93RD PSALM IS A PROPHECY OF THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST, THAT IT IS AS WIDE AS THE WORLD AND REMAINS FOREVER. ALTHOUGH FLOODS AND WATERS STORM AGAINST IT, THAT IS, THE WORLDS DEATH AND RAGE OPPOSE AND STRUGGLE AGAINST IT, THEY ACCOMPLISH NOTHING AT ALL FOR HE IS GREATER THAN THE WORLD AND ITS PRINCE. THIS KINGDOM AND ALL THINGS WILL BE ORDERED THROUGH HIS WORD, WITHOUT SWORD OR ARMOR. HE WILL ADORN HIS HOUSE AND MAKE IT HOLY. FOR THE TRUE WORSHIP THAT ADORNS AND ILLUMINATES THIS HOUSE IS PREACHING, PRAISE, AND THANKS GIVING, WHICH BELONG TO NEITHER MOSES NOR THE OLD TESTAMENT. 93 1 THE LORD REIGNS HE IS ROBED IN I MAJESTY THE LORD IS ROBED HE HAS PUT ON STRENGTH I AS HIS BELT. YES, THE WORLD IS ES-1 TABLISHED IT SHALL NEV-1 ER BE MOVED. 2 YOUR THRONE IS ESTABLISHED I FROM OF OLD YOU ARE FROM EVER-1 LASTING. 3 THE FLOODS HAVE LIFTED UP, O LORD, THE FLOODS HAVE LIFTED I UP THEIR VOICE THE FLOODS LIFT UP THEIR I ROARING. 4 MIGHTIER THAN THE THUNDERS OF MANY WATERS, MIGHTIER THAN THE WAVES I OF THE SEA, THE LORD ON HIGH IS 1 MIGHTY! 5 YOUR DECREES ARE VERY I TRUSTWORTHY HOLINESS BEFITS YOUR HOUSE, O LORD, FOR-1 EVERMORE. PSALM 94 PR A YLR LORD JESUS, TRIUMPHANT VICTOR AND GLORIOUS KING, CONTIN UE TO SPREAD YOUR KINGDOM ON EARTH, CONVERTING THE NATIONS FROM THE POWER OF DARKNESS UNTO YOUR LIGHT. PRESERVE YOUR GOSPEL IN ITS TRUTH AND PURITY TO US AND TO OUR CHILDREN IN ALL GENERATIONS. GRANT US TO WORSHIP YOU IN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TRUE HOLINESS ALL OUR DAYS, AND FINALLY RECEIVE US INTO THOSE GLORIOUS MANSIONS THAT YOU HAVE PREPARED IN THE HOUSE OF YOUR FATHER. AMEN. PSALM 94 HE 94TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER THAT, BY MY UNDERSTANDING, CRIES OUT NOT AGAINST THE HEATHEN BUT AGAINST THE KINGS AND PRINCES, PRIESTS, AND PROPHETS. THE PSAJMIST CALLS THEM FOOLS AMONG THE PEOPLE, SENSELESS ONES WHO TEACH AND RULE THE PEOPLE FOOLISHLY AND BADLY. THESE ARE THE ONES WHO KILL AND PERSECUTE ALL THE GODLY PROPHETS AND THEIR DISCIPLES. AS THE PSALMIST SAYS, THEY PRESUME UPON GOD. HE HAS GIVEN THEM THE POWER AND HAS STOOD BY AND WATCHED, NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THOSE WHOM THEY SLAUGHTERED AS CON DEMNED HERETICS AND REBELS. AGAINST THESE AUTHORITIES THE PSALMIST PRAYS, DESIRING HELP AND SUPPORT. ALTHOUGH HE FINDS NO HELP, HE TAKES COMFORT IN HIS CONFIDENCE THAT GODS WORD AND ACTIONS ARE RELIABLE, AND GOD WILL NOT ALLOW THE CORRUPT THRONE TO COME UPON THEM BUT WILL REPAY THEM FOR THEIR LIES AND MURDERS. AMEN. READING THE PSAIMS VMTH LUTHER 94 1 O LORD, GOD OF I VENGEANCE, O GOD OF VENGEANCE, I SHINE FORTH! 2 RISE UP, O JUDGE I OF THE EARTH REPAY TO THE PROUD WHAT I THEY DESERVE!  O LORD, HOW LONG SHALL THE I WICKED, HOW LONG SHALL THE WICK- I ED EXULT? 4 THEY POUR OUT THEIR AR- I ROGANT WORDS ALL THE EVIL- I DOERS BOAST. S THEY CRUSH YOUR PEOPLE, I O LORD, AND AFFLICT YOUR I HERITAGE. 6 THEY KILL THE WIDOW AND THE I SOJOURNER, AND MURDER THE I FATHERLESS 7 AND THEY SAY. THE LORD I DOES NOT SEE THE GOD OF JACOB DOES I NOT PERCEIVE. 8 UNDERSTAND. O DULLEST OF THE I PEOPLE! FOOLS, WHEN WILL I YOU BE WISE? 9 HE WHO PLANTED THE EAR, DOES I HE NOT HEAR? HE WHO FORMED THE EYE, DOES I HE NOT SEE? 10 HE WHO DISCIPLINES THE NATIONS, DOES HE I NOT REBUKE? HE WHO TEACHES MAN I KNOWLEDGE N THE LORD KNOWS THE I THOUGHTS OF MAN, THAT THEY ARE I BUT A BREATH. 12 BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOM YOU DISCIPLINE, I O LORD, AND WHOM YOU TEACH OUT I OF YOUR LAW, 13 TO GIVE HIM REST FROM DAYS OF I TROUBLE, UNTIL A PIT IS DUG FOR THE I WICKED. 14 FOR THE LORD WILL NOT FORSAKE HIS I PEOPLE HE WILL NOT ABANDON HIS I HERITAGE 15 FOR JUSTICE WILL RETURN TO THE I RIGHTEOUS, AND ALL THE UPRIGHT IN HEART WILL I FOLLOW IT. 24 PSALM 94 WHO RISES UP FOR ME AGAINST THE I WICKED? WHO STANDS UP LOR ME AGAINST EVIL- I DOERS? 17 IF THE LORD HAD NOT I BEEN MY HELP,' MY SOUL WOULD SOON HAVE LIVED IN THE LAND OF I SILENCE. T WHEN 1 THOUGHT, MY I FOOT SLIPS, 5  YOUR STEADFAST LOVE, O LORD, I HELD ME UP. ,9 WHEN THE CARES OF MY HEART ARE I MANY,' YOUR CONSOLATIONS I CHEER MY SOUL. 20 CAN WICKED RULERS BE ALLIED I WITH YOU| THOSE WHO FRAME INJUSTICE BY I STATUTE? 21 THEY BAND TOGETHER AGAINST THE LIFE OF THE I RIGHTEOUS' AND CONDEMN THE INNO- I CENT TO DEATH. 22 BUT THE LORD HAS BECOME MY I STRONGHOLD| AND MY GOD THE ROCK OF MY I REFUGE. 2 HE WILL BRING BACK ON THEM THEIR INIQUITY AND WIPE THEM OUT FOR THEIR I WICKEDNESS THE LORD OUR GOD WILL I WIPE THEM OUT. PRAYER LORD. YOU ARE A MERCIFUL AND A JEALOUS GOD. CONVERT YOUR ENEMIES, AND DRAW TO YOU THOSE THAT ARE GOING ASTRAY BUT RESTRAIN THE MALICIOUS PERSECUTORS OF YOUR CHURCH AND THE WILLFUL CORRUPTERS OF YOUR TRUTH. BRING THEIR COUNSELS TO NAUGHT, AND SHOW THAT YOU ARE THE LORD. BUILD YOUR CHURCH, AND MAKE IT A CITY UPON A HILL FOR THE SALVATION OF MANY, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 95 C-|HE 95TH PSALM IS A PROPHECY OF CHRIST THE LETTER TO THE HEBREWS EXTENSIVELY TREATS IT AS A PROPHECY OF THE TIME OF THE NEW TESTAMENT AND OF THE VOICE OF THE GOSPEL. IN SHORT, THE PSALM TEACHES AND CALLS US TO CHRIST AND TO THE WORD OF GOD, TO TRUE WORSHIP. THE PSALMIST WARNS US BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE FAITHLESS FATHERS IN THE WILDERNESS, WHO ALSO DID NOT COME INTO THE PROMISED LAND ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR UNBELIEF AND CONTEMPT FOR GOD. YOU MUST, HOWEVER, APPLY THE ENTIRE PSALM TO CHRIST: HE IS HIMSELF THE GOD WHOM WE ARE EXHORTED TO WORSHIP. HE HAS MADE US AND IS OUR SHEPHERD, AND WE ARE HIS SHEEP. HE IS THE ONE WHO TESTED THE UNBELIEVING FATHER, AS PAUL IN 1 CORINTHIANS 10:9 ALSO STATES. FROM HENCEFORTH HE WILL RECEIVE NO MOSAIC WORSHIP, BUT INSTEAD FAITH, JOYFUL PREACH ING, PRAISE, AND THANKSGIVING. 95 1 OH COME, LET US SING I TO THE LORD LET US MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE TO THE ROCK OF OUR SAL-1 VATION! 2 LET US COME INTO HIS PRESENCE WITH THANKS-1 GIVING LET US MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE TO HIM WITH I SONGS OF PRAISE! 3 FOR THE LORD IS A I GREAT GOD, AND A GREAT KING A-1 BOVE ALL GODS. 4 IN HIS HAND ARE THE DEPTHS I OF THE EARTH THE HEIGHTS OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE HIS I ALSO. 26 PSALM 95 5 THE SEA IS HIS, FOR HE I MADE IT| AND HIS HANDS FORMED THE I DRY LAND. 6 OH COME, LET US WORSHIP AND I BOW DOWN| LET US KNEEL BEFORE THE LORD, OUR I MAKER! 7 FOR HE I IS OUR GOD| AND WE ARE THE PEOPLE OF HIS PASTURE, AND THE SHEEP I OF HIS HAND. TODAY, IF YOU I HEAR HIS VOICE| 8 DO NOT HARDEN YOUR HEARTS, AS AT MERIBAH, AS ON THE DAY AT MASSAH IN THE I WILDERNESS, 9 WHEN YOUR FATHERS PUT ME I TO THE LEST " AND PUT ME TO THE PROOF, THOUGH THEY HAD I SEEN MY WORK. 10 FOR FORTY YEARS I LOATHED THAT GENERATION AND SAID, THEY ARE A PEOPLE WHO GO ASTRAY I IN THEIR HEART| AND THEY HAVE NOT I KNOWN MY WAYS. 11 THEREFORE I SWORE I IN MY WRATH| THEY SHALL NOT ENTER I MY REST  PR A YHR LORD JESUS, LEACH US TO PROFIT BY THE WARNING EXAMPLES OF OTHERS. SO GOVERN US THAT WE DO NOT HARDEN OUR HEARTS, AS DID THOSE AT MERIBAH. INCLINE OUR HEARTS TO YOUR GOSPEL, AND ENABLE US BY YOUR GOOD SPIRIT TO RECEIVE WITH MEEKNESS THE ENGRAFTED WORD THAT IS ABLE TO SAVE THE SOUL. SUFFER US NOT, O LORD, TO FALL FROM YOU, NEITHER IN LIFE NOR IN DEATH. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHEK PSALM 96 R S HE 96IH PSALM IS A PROPHECY OF THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST IN THE WORLD, IN WHICH SHOULD BE NOTHING BUT JOY AND PRAISE. THE TEXT IS, TRULY, ITSELF CLEAR ENOUGH. IN IT, ALL THE NATIONS, LANDS, PEOPLE, FORESTS, SEAS, TREES ARE CALLED TO WOR SHIP. THEY SHOULD PRAISE AND THANK THE LORD BECAUSE HE JUDGES AND RULES WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TRUTH. THAT IS, HE DELIVERS US FROM SINS AND ALL THAT SIN BRINGS WITH IT, SUCH AS DEATH, HELL, THE POWER OF THE DEVIL, AND ALL THAT IS EVIL. THIS IS THE NEW SONG OF THE NEW KINGDOM FROM NEW CREATURES, FROM A NEW PEOPLE, NOT BOM OF THE LAW OR WORKS BUT BOM OF GOD AND SPIRIT. THESE ARE NOTHING LESS THAN MIRACLES, DONE IN CHRIST JESUS, OUR LORD. 96 ' OH SING TO THE LORD A I NEW SONG SING TO THE LORD, I ALL THE EARTH! 2 SING TO THE LORD, I BLESS HIS NAME TELL OF HIS SALVATION FROM I DAY TO DAY. 3 DECLARE HIS GLORY AMONG THE I NATIONS, HIS MARVELOUS WORKS AMONG ALL THE I PEOPLES! 4 FOR GREAT IS THE LORD, AND GREATLY I TO BE PRAISED HE IS TO BE FEARED A-1 BOVE ALL GODS. 5 FOR ALL THE GODS OF THE PEOPLES ARE WORTHLESS I IDOLS, BUT THE LORD MADE THE I HEAVENS. 6 SPLENDOR AND MAJESTY ARE BE-1 FORE HIM STRENGTH AND BEAUTY ARE IN HIS SANCTU-1 ARY. 7 ASCRIBE TO THE LORD, O FAMILIES OF THE I PEOPLES, ASCRIBE TO THE LORD GLO-1 RY AND STRENGTH! PSALM 96  ASCRIBE LO THE LORD THE GLORY I DUE HIS NAME BRING AN OFFERING, AND COME IN- I TO HIS COURTS! 9 WORSHIP THE LORD IN THE SPLENDOR OF I HOLINESS TREMBLE BEFORE HIM, I ALL THE EARTH! SAY AMONG THE NATIONS, THE LORD REIGNS! YES, THE WORLD IS ESTABLISHED IT SHALL NEV- I ER BE MOVED HE WILL JUDGE THE PEOPLES WITH I EQUITY. 11 LET THE HEAVENS BE GLAD, AND LET THE I EARTH REJOICE LET THE SEA ROAR, AND ALL THAT FILLS IT 12 LET THE FIELD EXULT, AND EVERY- I THING IN IT! THEN SHALL ALL THE TREES OF THE FOREST SING FOR JOY 13 BEFORE THE LORD, I FOR HE COMES, FOR HE COMES TO I JUDGE THE EARTH. HE WILL JUDGE THE WORLD IN I RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND THE PEOPLES IN HIS I FAITHFULNESS. PRAYER THANKS TO YOU, O FATHER OF LIGHT, FOR SENDING YOUR SON, JESUS CHRIST, TO ESTABLISH A KINGDOM OF GRACE AND FORGIVENESS AMONG MEN ON THIS EARTH. BY YOUR SPIRIT MAKE US NEW CREA TURES IN HEART, MIND, SOUL, AND SENTIMENT, AND TEACH US TO SING THE NEW SONG OF THIS NEW KINGDOM WITH REJOICING AND GLAD NESS, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. 9 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 97 R  XHE 97TH PSALM IS A PROPHECY OF THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST, JUST AS THE PRECEDING PSALM WAS. AND THE SIGNIFI CANCE IS ALWAYS THIS, THAT CHRIST RULES AND MAINTAINS THIS KINGDOM THROUGH THE GOSPEL, THROUGH WHICH HE SENDS OUT THUNDER AND LIGHTNING AND BUMS HIS ENEMIES AND MELTS THE MOUNTAINS. THAT IS, HE BRINGS LOW ALL HOLINESS, ALL WISDOM, POWER, AND WHATEVER IS GREAT SO THAT THEY MIGHT BE HOLY, WISE, GREAT, AND POWERFUL THROUGH HIM ALONE. ALONG WITH THESE ENEMIES AND MOUNTAINS, THE ISRAELITE KINGDOM AND WORSHIP PERISH ALSO, AS WELL AS ALL THAT IS NOT CHRIST. FOR HE ALONE SHALL ENDURE, AND ALL OTHERS PASS AWAY, AS THE STONE IN DANIEL, CUT FROM THE MOUNTAINS, FILLS THE WHOLE WORLD AND SCATTERS EVERYTHING ELSE AND MAKES THEM TO NOTHING (DANIEL 2:34). HE WILL BE THE MOUNTAIN FILLING THE WHOLE WORLD. 97 1 THE LORD REIGNS, LET THE I EARTH REJOICE LET THE MANY COAST-1 LANDS BE GLAD! 2 CLOUDS AND THICK DARKNESS ARE ALL A-1 ROUND HIM RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE ARE THE FOUNDATION I OF HIS THRONE. 3 FIRE GOES BE-1 FORE HIM AND BUMS UP HIS ADVERSARIES I ALL AROUND. 4 HIS LIGHTNINGS LIGHT I UP THE WORLD THE EARTH SEES AND I TREMBLES. S THE MOUNTAINS MELT LIKE WAX BE-1 FORE THE LORD, BEFORE THE LORD OF I ALL THE EARTH. 30 PSALM 97 6 THE HEAVENS PROCLAIM HIS I RIGHTEOUSNESS| AND ALL THE PEOPLES SEE HIS I GLORY. 7 ALL WORSHIPERS OF IMAGES ARE PUT TO SHAME, WHO MAKE THEIR BOAST IN WORTHLESS I IDOLS WORSHIP HIM, I ALL YOU GODS! 8 ZION HEARS AND IS GLAD, AND THE DAUGHTERS OF JU- I DAH REJOICE, BECAUSE OF YOUR JUDGMENTS, I O LORD. 9 FOR YOU, O LORD, ARE MOST HIGH OVER I ALL THE EARTH YOU ARE EXALTED FAR A- I BOVE ALL GODS. 10 O YOU WHO LOVE THE LORD, HATE I EVIL! HE PRESERVES THE LIVES OF HIS SAINTS HE DELIVERS THEM FROM THE HAND OF THE I WICKED. 11 LIGHT IS SOWN FOR THE I RIGHTEOUS, AND JOY FOR THE UP- I RIGHT IN HEART. 12 REJOICE IN THE LORD, O YOU I RIGHTEOUS, AND GIVE THANKS TO HIS I HOLY NAME! PRAYER ROCK OF AGES, CLEFT FOR ME, LET ME HIDE MYSELF IN THEE LET THE WATER AND THE BLOOD, FROM THY RIVEN SIDE WHICH FLOWED. BE OF SIN THE DOUBLE CURE: CLEANSE ME FROM ITS GUILT AND POWR. AMEN. (LSB 761 : 1 ) READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 9H R SZ 98TH PSALM, LIKE THE PRECEDING PSALM, IS A PROPHECY OF THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST, WHICH EXTENDS INTO ALL THE WORLD. IT ALSO CALLS US TO BE JOYFUL AND TO PRAISE GOD FOR HIS SALVATION, THAT IS, TO PREACH AND GIVE THANKS FOR THE REDEMPTION GIVEN US THROUGH CHRIST. HERE THEN IS WORSHIP NOT OFFERINGS GIVEN IN JERUSALEM, BUT PREACHING AND THANKS GIVING THAT HE IS KING IN RIGHTEOUSNESS OVER THE ENTIRE WORLD, THAT IS, THAT HE HAS REDEEMED US FROM SIN AND DEATH BY HIMSELF ALONE, WITHOUT OUR MERITS. 93 1 OH SING TO THE LORD A NEW SONG, FOR HE HAS DONE I MARVELOUS THINGS! HIS RIGHT HAND AND HIS HOLY ARM HAVE WORKED SALVA-1 TION FOR HIM. 2 THE LORD HAS MADE KNOWN HIS SAL-1 VATION HE HAS REVEALED HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE SIGHT OF THE I NATIONS. 3 HE HAS REMEMBERED HIS STEADFAST LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS TO THE HOUSE OF I ISRAEL. ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH HAVE SEEN THE SALVATION I OF OUR GOD. 4 MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE TO THE LORD, I ALL THE EARTH BREAK FORTH INTO JOYOUS SONG AND SING I PRAISES! 5 SING PRAISES TO THE LORD I WITH THE LYRE, WITH THE LYRE AND THE SOUND OF I MELODY! 6 WITH TRUMPETS AND THE SOUND I OF THE HOM MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE BEFORE THE I KING, THE LORD! 7 LET THE SEA ROAR, AND ALL THAT I FILLS IT THE WORLD AND THOSE WHO I DWELL IN IT! 232 PSALM 99  LEI THE RIVERS CLAP THEIR HANDS LET THE HILLS SING FOR JOY TOGETHER 9 BE-1 FORE THE LORD, FOR HE COMES TO I JUDGE THE EARTH. HE WILL JUDGE THE WORLD WITH I RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND THE PEOPLES WITH I EQUITY. PR A YER HONOR, PRAISE, AND THANKSGIVING TO YOU, O CHRIST, OUR GOD AND SAVIOR, FOR ALL YOUR WONDERFUL WORKS AND THE NUM BERLESS BLESSINGS WITH WHICH YOU ENRICH US. FILL US WITH YOUR SPIRIT AND CREATE IN US NEW HEARTS, THAT WE MAY REJOICE OVER YOUR WORKS AND GIFTS ALL OUR DAYS, AND AT OUR LATTER END RECEIVE US INTO THAT KINGDOM OF LIGHT IN WHICH WE SHALL FOL LOW YOU WHEREVER YOU GO. AMEN. . R 99TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION THAT EXHORTS THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TO PRAISE THEIR GOD IN ZIONDESPITE THE FACT THAT THE NATIONS RAGE AGAINST THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE A SPE CIAL PEOPLE OF GOD BEFORE ALL OTHERS. THEY SUFFER MUCH ON THAT PSALM 99 ACCOUNT. THE PSALMIST PRAISES MOSES, AARON, AND SAMUEL, WHO WERE CHIEF AMONG THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL. HOWEVER, (AS THE WORDS DECLARE) HE ALSO TEACHES THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL THEM SELVES THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT TRUE WORSHIP CONSISTS NOT IN THE SACRIFICE OF MANY CATTLE, BUT RATHER IN KNOWING GODS WONDERS AND GIVING HIM THANKS FOR MAKING THEM GODLY AND REDEEMING THEM FROM SIN. THIS PSALM IS ALSO A PROPHECY OF CHRIST, WHO RULES THE TRUE ZION IN ALL THE WORLD AND HAS ESTAB- 33 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER LISHED HIS THRONE OF GRACE AND HIS FOOTSTOOL IN HEAVEN, ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH ALL THE WORLD IS NOW ANGRY, RAVING, AND FOOL ISH, AND PERSECUTES AND KILLS THE CHRISTIANS. 99 1 THE LORD REIGNS LET THE PEOPLES I TREMBLE! HE SITS ENTHRONED UPON THE CHERUBIM LET THE I EARTH QUAKE! 2 THE LORD IS GREAT IN I ZION HE IS EXALTED OVER ALL THE I PEOPLES. 3 LET THEM PRAISE YOUR GREAT AND I AWESOME NAME! HO-1 LY IS HE! 4 THE KING IN HIS MIGHT LOVES I JUSTICE. YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED EQUITY YOU HAVE EXECUTED JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS IN I JACOB. 5 EXALT THE LORD OUR GOD WORSHIP AT HIS I FOOTSTOOL! HO-1 LY IS HE! 6 MOSES AND AARON WERE AMONG HIS PRIESTS, SAMUEL ALSO WAS AMONG THOSE WHO CALLED UP- I ON HIS NAME. THEY CALLED TO THE LORD, AND HE I ANSWERED THEM. 7 IN THE PILLAR OF THE CLOUD HE I SPOKE TO THEM THEY KEPT HIS TESTIMONIES AND THE STATUTE THAT HE I GAVE THEM. 8 O LORD OUR GOD, YOU I ANSWERED THEM YOU WERE A FORGIVING GOD TO THEM, BUT AN AVENGER OF THEIR WRONG- I DOINGS. 9 EXALT THE LORD OUR GOD, AND WORSHIP AT HIS HOLY I MOUNTAIN FOR THE LORD OUR GOD IS I HOLY! 234 PSALM 100 PRAYER LORD JESUS, BE OUR GUIDE AND OUR DEFENSE IN THIS EVIL WORLD, THAT WE MAY NEVER BE ASHAMED TO CONFESS YOU BEFORE MEN, BUT MAY SERVE YOU IN HOLY CONVERSATION AND CONSTANT FIDELITY. RESTRAIN THE EVIL COUNSELS OF THOSE WHO SET THEM SELVES AGAINST YOU AND YOUR CHURCH, AND CAUSE THEM TO SEE THE EVIL OF THEIR WAYS, THAT THEY MAY BE TURNED TO YOU. AMEN. C-NE 100TH PSALM IS A PROPHECY OF CHRIST. IT CALLS ON THE ENTIRE WORLD TO BE JOYFUL, TO PRAISE, AND TO GIVE THANKS, THAT IS, TO WORSHIP GOD AND COME TO HIS THRONE AND HIS COURTS, AND TO CALL ON HIM WITH ALL CONFIDENCE. FOR HIS GRACE IS AN ETERNAL KINGDOM, WHICH TRULY REMAINS FOREVER AND EVER. 1 MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE TO THE LORD, I ALL THE EARTH! 2 "SERVE THE LORD WITH GLADNESS! COME INTO HIS PRESENCE WITH I SINGING! 3 KNOW THAT THE LORD, I HE IS GOD! IT IS HE WHO MADE US, AND WE ARE HIS WE ARE HIS PEOPLE, AND THE SHEEP OF HIS I PASTURE. 4 ENTER HIS GATES WITH THANKSGIVING, AND HIS I COURTS WITH PRAISE! GIVE THANKS TO HIM I BLESS HIS NAME! 5 FOR THE LORD IS GOOD HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOR-1 EVER, AND HIS FAITHFULNESS TO ALL GENER-1 ATIONS. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PRAYER SPIRIT OF GRACE AND OF PRAYER THAT PROCEEDS FROM THE FATHER AND THE SON, GRANT US YOUR POWER, AND INTERCEDE FOR US WITH SIGHINGS WHICH CANNOT BE UTTERED, THAT IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH WE MAY GIVE THANKS TO OUR SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST FOR HIS LOVE AND TRUTH. ANOINT US WITH THE OIL OF GLADNESS TO WALK BEFORE OUR GOD IN A HOLY CONVERSATION, AND TO RUN THE WAY OF HIS COMMANDMENTS. AMEN. PSALM 101 R 101ST PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION IN WHICH DAVID USES HIMSELF AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO HAVE GODLY HELPERS AND NOT TOLERATE EVIL SERVANTS. HE ACCORDINGLY LISTS THE VARIOUS LUSTS AND VICES OF AN EVIL WORKER, WHICH BELONGS IN A LONGER COMMENTARY TO EXPLAIN. THIS HE CALLS SINGING OF STEADFAST LOVE AND JUSTICE, THAT IS, SINGING OF HOW GOD IS GRACIOUS TO THE GODLY AND PUNISHES THE WICKED, AND HOW EVERY WORK SHOULD BE DOING GOOD AND SHUNNING EVIL. HOW IT SHALL GO WITH THEM ON THESE ACCOUNTS IS WELL DEPICTED IN ABSALOM, AHITHOPHEL, JOAB, AND OTHERS. FOR WHOEVER WANTS TO MAKE AND KEEP THE PEOPLE GODLY SHALL BE BURDENED WITH ALL HATRED AND ENVY. THEREFORE, HE MAY WELL SING TO GOD AND GIVE THANKS TO HIM WHO HAS GIVEN GRACE AND JUSTICE. WHERE GOD DOES NOT GIVE THIS, SUCH A SONG WOULD REMAIN UNSUNG. IN ITS PLACE ONLY CURSING AND SCOLDING WOULD REMAIN IN THE HOUSE AND THE ONLY HOPE BE HANGING AND BEHEADINGS AND THE LIKE. 36 PSALM 101 |?| 1 I WILL SING OF STEADFAST LOVE AND I JUSTICE TO YOU, O LORD, I WILL MAKE I MUSIC. 2 1 WILL PONDER THE WAY THAT IS BLAMELESS. OH WHEN WILL YOU I COME TO ME? I WILL WALK WITH INTEGRITY OF HEART WITH-1 IN MY HOUSE 3 1 WILL NOT SET BEFORE MY EYES ANYTHING THAT IS I WORTHLESS. I HATE THE WORK OF THOSE WHO FALL AWAY IT SHALL NOT I CLING TO ME. 4 A PERVERSE HEART SHALL BE I FAR FROM ME I WILL KNOW NOTHING OF I EVIL. 5 WHOEVER SLANDERS HIS NEIGHBOR SECRETLY 11 WILL DESTROY. WHOEVER HAS A HAUGHTY LOOK AND AN ARROGANT HEART I WILL I NOT ENDURE. 6 I WILL LOOK WITH FAVOR ON THE FAITHFUL IN THE LAND, THAT THEY MAY I DWELL WITH ME HE WHO WALKS IN THE WAY THAT IS BLAMELESS SHALL MINIS-1 TER TO ME. 7 NO ONE WHO PRACTICES DECEIT SHALL DWELL I IN MY HOUSE NO ONE WHO UTTERS LIES SHALL CONTINUE BE-1 FORE MY EYES. 8 MORNING BY MORNING 1 WILL DESTROY ALL THE WICKED I IN THE LAND, CUTTING OFF ALL THE EVILDOERS FROM THE CITY I OF THE LORD. 37 RFCADING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PRAYER LORD, OUR GOD, LORD OF LORDS AND KING OF KINGS, THANKS BE TO YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE BLESSED OUR BELOVED COUNTRY WITH GOOD AND GENEROUS INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT. PRESERVE CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY TO OUR CHILDREN AND US. GIVE ABLE AND FAITHFUL RULERS IN OFFICES HIGH AND LOW, AND CAUSE RIGH TEOUSNESS AND PEACE TO FLOURISH IN THE LAND UNTO ITS WELFARE AND YOUR PRAISE. AMEN. R- PSALM 102 HE 102ND PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER. IN IT THE FATHERS OF OLDWEARY OF LAWS, OF SINS, AND OF DEATHWHOLE HEARTEDLY YEARN AND CALL FOR THE KINGDOM OF GRACE PROMISED IN CHRIST. THEY ASK THAT GOD YET AGAIN BUILD UP ZION AND SET IN PLACE HER STONES AND DUST, THAT HE WOULD YET AGAIN ENTER IN AND LET HIS GLORY BE SEEN IN ALL KINGDOMS, THAT HE WOULD RESCUE HIS CAPTIVES FROM SIN AND DEATH SO THAT THEY MAY COME TOGETHER AND THANK HIMTHAT IS, THAT THEY MAY WOR SHIP HIM IN THE TRUE ZIONAND THE OLD TESTAMENT COME TO AN END. FOR WITHOUT CHRIST THERE IS INDEED NOTHING BUT STRENGTH BROKEN IN THE MIDDLE OF LIFE AND DAYS CUT SHORT, THAT IS, A MIS ERABLE, SHORT, WRETCHED LIFE FROM WHICH THE PSALMIST IS RELUC TANTLY REMOVED. BUT IN HIS KINGDOM IS ETERNAL LIFE, AND HIS TIME HAS NO END. HE IS THE ONE WHO WAS BEFORE HE CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH, AND WILL AGAIN CHANGE AND RENEW THEM.

TAKE ME NOT AWAY IN THE MIDST L OF MY DAYS YOU WHOSE YEARS ENDURE THROUGHOUT ALL GENER- I ATIONS! 25 OF OLD YOU LAID THE FOUNDATION I OF THE EARTH, AND THE HEAVENS ARE THE WORK I OF YOUR HANDS. 26 THEY WILL PERISH, BUT YOU I WILL REMAIN THEY WILL ALL WEAR OUT LIKE A I GARMENT. YOU WILL CHANGE THEM LIKE A ROBE, AND THEY WILL I PASS AWAY, 27 BUT YOU ARE THE SAME, AND YOUR YEARS I HAVE NO END. 28 THE CHILDREN OF YOUR SERVANTS SHALL I DWELL SECURE THEIR OFFSPRING SHALL BE ESTABLISHED BE- I FORE YOU. PRAYER THANKS BE TO YOU, LORD JESUS, BECAUSE IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME YOU CAME AND REDEEMED US FROM THE POWER OF THAT ARMED STRONG MAN. BUILD YOUR KINGDOM OF GRACE AMONG US, MAKE US FREE FROM THE BONDS OF SIN AND THE FEAR OF DEATH, AND WHEN THE APPOINTED TIME HAS COME, RECEIVE US GRACIOUSLY OUT OF THIS VALE OF TEARS INTO YOUR EVERLASTING KINGDOM OF GLORY. AMEN.  4 | READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 103 C|SALM 103 IS A PSALM OF LHANKS, BEAUTIFULLY AND LOV INGLY MADE, IN WHICH THE PSALMIST THANKS GOD FOR ALL HIS GOODNESS, NAMELY, FORGIVENESS OF SINS, MAKING A SOUND BODY AND SOUL, GIVING US ENOUGH OF ALL SORTS OF GOODS, MAKING US JOYFUL AND CONFIDENT, DELIVERING US FROM ENEMIES AND DIS TRESS. IN SHORT, THE PSALMIST THANKS GOD THAT HE IS A GRACIOUS, COMPASSIONATE, AND LOVING FATHER TOWARD US, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE FRAIL AND UNSTEADY CREATURES. GOD DOES NOT DEAL WITH US ACCORDING TO OUR SINS, BUT ACCORDING TO HIS GRACIOUS GOOD NESS IN US, WHO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM AND KEEP HIS COVENANT. THAT IS, WE BELIEVE IN HIM AND GLADLY WILL BE GODLY AND NEI THER ARROGANT NOR STIFF-NECKED IN OUR HOLINESS AND RIGHTEOUS NESS (WHICH WOULD INDEED BE A STRIVING DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO THE COVENANT, ESPECIALLY THE FIRST COMMANDMENT). THIS ALL COMES TO PASS IN CHRIST, WHO FOR THIS REASON WAS PROMISED AND NOW IS COME, WHOSE KINGDOM REIGNS OVER ALL. FOR AT THE END, WHERE HE CALLS ON THE ANGELS, MIGHTY ONES, SERVANTS, HOSTS, TO GIVE HIM PRAISE AND LET HIS WORD BE HEARD, I AM OF THE OPINION THAT THE PSALM IS SPEAKING OF CHRIST AND HIS APOSTLES, GOSPEL, AND CHURCHWHERE SUCH GRACE RULES FOR WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT SAVES US ALL COMES TO PASS IN CHRIST AND NOT OUTSIDE OF HIM. |03 1 BLESS THE LORD, I O MY SOUL, AND ALL THAT IS WITHIN ME, BLESS HIS I HOLY NAME! 2 BLESS THE LORD, I O MY SOUL, AND FORGET NOT ALL HIS I BENEFITS, 3 WHO FORGIVES ALL YOUR IN-1 IQUITY, WHO HEALS ALL YOUR DIS-1 EASES. PSALM 103 4 W HO REDEEMS YOUR LIFE I FROM THE PIT, WHO CROWNS YOU WITH STEADFAST LOVE AND I MERCY, 5 WHO SATISFIES I YOU WITH GOOD SO THAT YOUR YOUTH IS RENEWED LIKE THE I EAGLES. 6 THE LORD WORKS I RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE FOR ALL WHO I ARE OPPRESSED. 7 HE MADE KNOWN HIS WAYS TO I MOSES, HIS ACTS TO THE PEOPLE OF I ISRAEL. 8 THE LORD IS MERCIFUL AND I GRACIOUS, SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN I STEADFAST LOVE. 9 HE WILL NOT I ALWAYS CHIDE, NOR WILL HE KEEP HIS ANGER FOR-1 EVER. HE DOES NOT DEAL WITH US ACCORDING I TO OUR SINS, NOR REPAY US ACCORDING TO OUR IN- I IQUITIES. 11 FOR AS HIGH AS THE HEAVENS ARE A-1 BOVE THE EARTH, SO GREAT IS HIS STEADFAST LOVE TOWARD THOSE WHO I FEAR HIM 12 AS FAR AS THE EAST IS I FROM THE WEST, SO FAR DOES HE REMOVE OUR TRANSGRES- I SIONS FROM US. N AS A FATHER SHOWS COMPASSION TO HIS I CHILDREN, SO THE LORD SHOWS COMPASSION TO THOSE WHO I FEAR HIM. 14 FOR HE I KNOWS OUR FRAME HE REMEMBERS THAT I WE ARE DUST. IS AS FOR MAN, HIS DAYS I ARE LIKE GRASS HE FLOURISHES LIKE A FLOWER I OF THE FIELD I 6 FOR THE WIND PASSES OVER IT, AND I IT IS GONE, AND ITS PLACE KNOWS I IT NO MORE. '2 BUT THE STEADFAST LOVE OF THE LORD IS FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING ON THOSE WHO I FEAR HIM, AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS TO CHILDRENS I CHILDREN, READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 18 TO THOSE WHO KEEP HIS I COVENANT AND REMEMBER TO DO HIS COM I MANDMENTS. 19 THE LORD HAS ESTABLISHED HIS THRONE IN THE I HEAVENS, AND HIS KINGDOM RULES I OVER ALL. 20 BLESS THE LORD, O YOU HIS I ANGELS, YOU MIGHTY ONES WHO DO HIS WORD, OBEYING THE VOICE I OF HIS WORD! 21 BLESS THE LORD, I ALL HIS HOSTS, HIS MINISTERS, WHO I DO HIS WILL! 22 BLESS THE LORD, ALL HIS WORKS, IN ALL PLACES OF HIS DO- I MINION. BLESS THE LORD, I O MY SOUL! PRAYER FATHER OF LIGHT, WE PRAISE YOU BECAUSE YOU FORGIVE INIQ UITY AND DO NOT REWARD US ACCORDING TO OUR SINS. WHAT YOU PROMISED TO THE FATHERS YOU HAVE FULFILLED IN YOUR SON. AS THE EAST AND THE WEST CAN NEVER COME TOGETHER, SO REMOVE OUR SINS FAR FROM US, THAT THEY CAN BE ACCOUNTED TO US NO MORE, FOR THE SAKE OF JESUS CHRIST, OUR SAVIOR. AMEN. S- PSALM 104 ME 104TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS FOR ALL THE WORKS THAT GOD HAD ACCOMPLISHED IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH, BEYOND THOSE DONE FOR US HERE ON EARTH. HE HAS SURELY ORDERED ALL THINGS ACCORDING TO A WISE PLACE TO PRODUCE WORKS, FRUITS, AND CROPS. THE PSALMIST RECOUNTS THESE ONE AFTER THE OTHER: THE HEAVENSFULL OF LIGHT AND OUTSTRETCHED AS A TAPESTRY WITHOUT POST OR RAFTERS THE CLOUDSAN ARCH 44 PSALM 104 WITHOUT FOUNDATION OR PILLAR THE WIND FLYING WITHOUT WINGS THE ANGELS GOING AND COMING, APPEARING LIKE A WIND OR A FLAME. THUS SINGS THE PSALMIST. HE FINDS HIS DESIRES AND JOY IN GODS CREATIONS, WHICH ARE SO WONDERFULLY MADE AND SO BEAUTIFULLY ORDERED TOGETHER. BUT WHO PAYS ATTENTION TO THIS OR SEES THAT THIS IS SO? ONLY FAITH AND THE SPIRIT. 1 BLESS THE LORD, I O MY SOUL! O LORD MY GOD, YOU ARE I VERY GREAT! YOU ARE CLOTHED WITH SPLENDOR AND I MAJESTY, 2 COVERING YOURSELF WITH LIGHT AS WITH A GARMENT, STRETCHING OUT THE HEAVENS I LIKE A LENT. 3 HE LAYS THE BEAMS OF HIS CHAMBERS ON THE I WATERS HE MAKES THE CLOUDS HIS CHARIOT HE RIDES ON THE WINGS I OF THE WIND 4 HE MAKES HIS MES-1 SENGERS WINDS, HIS MINISTERS A I FLAMING FIRE. 5 HE SET THE EARTH ON ITS FOUN-1 DATIONS, SO THAT IT SHOULD NEV-1 ER BE MOVED. 6 YOU COVERED IT WITH THE DEEP AS WITH A I GARMENT THE WATERS STOOD ABOVE THE I MOUNTAINS. 7 AT YOUR RE-1 BUKE THEY FLED AT THE SOUND OF YOUR THUNDER THEY I TOOK TO FLIGHT. 8 THE MOUNTAINS ROSE, THE VALLEYS I SANK DOWN TO THE PLACE THAT YOU APPOINT-1 ED FOR THEM. 9 YOU SET A BOUNDARY THAT THEY I MAY NOT PASS, SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT AGAIN COV-1 ER THE EARTH. 10 YOU MAKE SPRINGS GUSH FORTH IN THE I VALLEYS THEY FLOW BE-1 TWEEN THE HILLS READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 11 THEY GIVE DRINK TO EVERY BEAST I OF THE FIELD THE WILD DONKEYS I QUENCH THEIR THIRST. 12 BESIDE THEM THE BIRDS OF THE I HEAVENS DWELL THEY SING AMONG THE I BRANCHES. 13 FROM YOUR LOFTY ABODE YOU WATER THE I MOUNTAINS THE EARTH IS SATISFIED WITH THE FRUIT I OF YOUR WORK. 14 YOU CAUSE THE GRASS TO GROW FOR THE LIVESTOCK AND PLANTS FOR MAN TO I CULTIVATE, THAT HE MAY BRING FORTH FOOD FROM THE EARTH 15 AND WINE TO GLADDEN THE I HEART OF MAN, OIL TO MAKE HIS I FACE SHINE AND BREAD TO STRENGTHEN I MANS HEART. PRAYER GOD, WHO IN SIX DAYS MADE ALL THE CREATURES AND ORDERED THEM FOR THE BENEFIT OF MAN. YOU ARE WORTHY OF PRAISE. TEACH US TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF ALL THAT IS, AND GRANT THAT WE MAY NEVER ABUSE YOUR CREATION TO OUR OWN DESTRUC TION, BUT USE ALL OF CREATION TO YOUR GLORY AND OUR WELFARE, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. 16 THE TREES OF THE LORD ARE WATERED A-1 BUNDANTLY, THE CEDARS OF LEBANON THAT HE I PLANTED. 17 IN THEM THE BIRDS I BUILD THEIR NESTS THE STORK HAS HER HOME IN THE I FIR TREES. 18 THE HIGH MOUNTAINS ARE FOR THE I WILD GOATS THE ROCKS ARE A REFUGE FOR THE ROCK I BADGERS. 19 HE MADE THE MOON TO MARK THE I SEASONS THE SUN KNOWS ITS TIME FOR I SETTING. 20 YOU MAKE DARKNESS, AND I IT IS NIGHT, WHEN ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST I CREEP ABOUT. 46 PSALM 104 21 THE YOUNG LIONS ROAR I FOR THEIR PREY, SEEKING THEIR I FOOD FROM GOD. 22 WHEN THE SUN RISES, THEY I STEAL AWAY AND LIE DOWN I IN THEIR DENS. 23 MAN GOES OUT I TO HIS WORK AND TO HIS LABOR UNTIL THE I EVENING. 2 O LORD, HOW MANIFOLD ARE YOUR WORKS! IN WISDOM HAVE YOU I MADE THEM ALL THE EARTH IS FULL OF YOUR I CREATURES. 25 HERE IS THE SEA, I GREAT AND WIDE, WHICH TEEMS WITH CREATURES INNUMERABLE, LIVING THINGS BOTH I SMALL AND GREAT. 26 THERE I GO THE SHIPS, AND LEVIATHAN, WHICH YOU FORMED TO I PLAY IN IT. 27 THESE ALL I LOOK TO YOU, TO GIVE THEM THEIR FOOD IN DUE I SEASON. 2 WHEN YOU GIVE IT TO THEM, THEY GATH-1 ER IT UP WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR HAND, THEY ARE FILLED WITH I GOOD THINGS. 29 WHEN YOU HIDE YOUR FACE, THEY I ARE DISMAYED WHEN YOU LAKE AWAY THEIR BREATH, THEY DIE AND RETURN I TO THEIR DUST. 30 WHEN YOU SEND FORTH YOUR SPIRIT, THEY ARE ERE-1 ATED, AND YOU RENEW THE FACE I OF THE GROUND. 31 MAY THE GLORY OF THE LORD ENDURE FOR-1 EVER MAY THE LORD REJOICE I IN HIS WORKS, 32 WHO LOOKS ON THE EARTH AND IT I TREMBLES, WHO TOUCHES THE MOUNTAINS I AND THEY SMOKE! 33 1 WILL SING TO THE LORD AS LONG I AS I LIVE I WILL SING PRAISE TO MY GOD WHILE I HAVE I BEING.  24|7 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 34 MAY MY MEDITATION BE PLEAS-1 ING TO HIM, FOR I REJOICE I IN THE LORD. 35 LET SINNERS BE CONSUMED FROM THE EARTH, AND LET THE WICKED I BE NO MORE! BLESS THE LORD, O MY SOUL! I PRAISE THE LORD! PRA YER FATHER IN HEAVEN, WHO PROVIDES FOR ALL YOUR CREATURES, SUPPLY US WITH ALL THAT WE NEED FOR THE SUPPORT OF THIS BODY AND LIFE, EVEN AS YOUR SON TAUGHT US TO PRAY: GIVE US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD. FILL US WITH JOYOUS CONFIDENCE TOWARD YOU, THAT WORRYING CARES BE BANISHED FROM OUR HEARTS, AND WE MAY NEVER DOUBT THAT YOU WILL SO BLESS OUR LABORS AS TO PROVIDE US WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING, AND TEACH US TO BE THERE WITH CONTENT. AMEN. PSALM 105 ME 105TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS IN WHICH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GIVE THANKS FOR ALL THE MIRACLES OF OLD THAT GOD HAD DONE FROM ABRAHAM ON, UNTIL THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN. THE PSALMIST RECOUNTS THEM ALL ONE AFTER ANOTHER. HE CONCLUDES AS MOSES DID (DEUTERONOMY 9:4-6), NOTING THAT GOD HAD NOT DONE SUCH WONDERS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR GOODNESS OR MERIT, BUT FOR THE SAKE OF HIS COVENANT AND PROMISES THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO ABRAHAM. HOW PIOUS THEY REALLY WERE AND WHAT THEY TRULY DESERVED IS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING PSALM.  4  PSALM 10S 1 OH GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD CALL UP-1 ON HIS NAME MAKE KNOWN HIS DEEDS AMONG THE I PEOPLES! 2 SING TO HIM, SING PRAIS-1 ES TO HIM TELL OF ALL HIS I WONDROUS WORKS! 3 GLORY IN HIS I HOLY NAME LET THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO SEEK THE I LORD REJOICE! 4 SEEK THE LORD I AND HIS STRENGTH SEEK HIS PRESENCE CON-1 TINUALLY! 5 REMEMBER THE WONDROUS WORKS THAT I HE HAS DONE, HIS MIRACLES, AND THE JUDGMENTS HE I UTTERED, 6 O OFFSPRING OF ABRAHAM, HIS I SERVANT, CHILDREN OF JACOB, HIS I CHOSEN ONES! 7 HE IS THE I LORD OUR GOD HIS JUDGMENTS ARE IN I ALL THE EARTH. 8 HE REMEMBERS HIS COVENANT FOR-1 EVER, THE WORD THAT HE COMMANDED, FOR A THOUSAND GENER-1 ATIONS, 9 THE COVENANT THAT HE MADE WITH I ABRAHAM, HIS SWORN PROMISE TO I ISAAC, 10 WHICH HE CONFIRMED TO JACOB AS A I STATUTE, TO ISRAEL AS AN EVERLASTING COVENANT, I 11 SAYING, TO YOU I WILL GIVE THE LAND OF I CANAAN AS YOUR PORTION FOR AN IN-1 HERITANCE 12 WHEN THEY WERE FEW IN I NUMBER, OF LITTLE ACCOUNT, AND SOJOURNERS I IN IT, 13 WANDERING FROM NATION TO I NATION, FROM ONE KINGDOM TO ANOTHER I PEOPLE, 14 HE ALLOWED NO ONE TO OP-1 PRESS THEM HE REBUKED KINGS ON THEIR ACCOUNT, I 15 SAYING, TOUCH NOT MY A-1 NOINTED ONES, DO MY PROPHETS I NO HARM! 249 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 16 WHEN HE SUMMONED A FAMINE I ON THE LAND AND BROKE ALL SUP-1 PLY OF BREAD, 17 HE HAD SENT A MAN A-1 HEAD OF THEM, JOSEPH, WHO WAS SOLD I AS A SLAVE. 18 HIS FEET WERE HURT WITH I FETTERS HIS NECK WAS PUT IN A COL-1 LAR OF IRON 19 UNTIL WHAT HE HAD SAID I CAME TO PASS, THE WORD OF THE LORD I TESTED HIM. 20 THE KING SENT AND RE-1 LEASED HIM THE RULER OF THE PEOPLES I SET HIM FREE 21 HE MADE HIM LORD I OF HIS HOUSE AND RULER OF ALL HIS POS-1 SESSIONS, 22 TO BIND HIS PRINCES AT HIS I PLEASURE AND TO TEACH HIS ELDERS I WISDOM. PRAYER ACCORDING TO YOUR MERCY, YOU, O GOD, HAVE ESTABLISHED A COVENANT WITH US IN HOLY BAPTISM IN WHICH YOU HAVE OBLI GATED YOURSELF TO BE OUR GOD AND TO FORGIVE OUR SINS FOR CHRISTS SAKE. THANKS, EVERLASTING THANKS, BE UNTO YOU THIS GRACIOUS COVENANT. AND NOW GRANT US GRACE TO BELIEVE YOUR WORD, AND STRENGTH TO PERSEVERE TO THE END, THAT WE MAY ADORN OUR PROFESSION IN ALL THINGS, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. 23 THEN ISRAEL CAME TO I EGYPT JACOB SOJOURNED IN THE I LAND OF HAM. 24 AND THE LORD MADE HIS PEOPLE VERY I FRUITFUL AND MADE THEM STRONGER I THAN THEIR FOES. 25 HE TURNED THEIR HEARTS TO HATE HIS I PEOPLE, TO DEAL CRAFTILY WITH HIS I SERVANTS. 26 HE SENT MOSES, HIS I SERVANT, AND AARON, WHOM HE HAD I CHOSEN. PSALM 105 27 THEY PERFORMED HIS SIGNS A-1 MONG THEM AND MIRACLES IN THE I LAND OF HAM. 28 HE SENT DARKNESS, AND MADE THE I LAND DARK THEY DID NOT REBEL A-1 GAINST HIS WORDS. 29 HE TURNED THEIR WATERS I INTO BLOOD AND CAUSED THEIR I FISH TO DIE. 30 THEIR LAND I SWARMED WITH FROGS, EVEN IN THE CHAMBERS I OF THEIR KINGS. 31 HE SPOKE, AND THERE CAME I SWARMS OF FLIES, AND GNATS THROUGHOUT THEIR I COUNTRY. 32 HE GAVE THEM I HAIL FOR RAIN, AND FIERY LIGHTNING BOLTS I THROUGH THEIR LAND. 33 HE STRUCK DOWN THEIR VINES AND I FIG TREES, AND SHATTERED THE TREES OF THEIR I COUNTRY. 34 HE SPOKE, AND THE I LOCUSTS CAME, YOUNG LOCUSTS WITHOUT I NUMBER, 35 WHICH DEVOURED ALL THE VEGETATION I IN THEIR LAND AND ATE UP THE FRUIT I OF THEIR GROUND. 36 HE STRUCK DOWN ALL THE FIRSTBORN I IN THEIR LAND, THE FIRSTFRUITS OF I ALL THEIR STRENGTH. 37 THEN HE BROUGHT OUT ISRAEL WITH SIL-1 VER AND GOLD, AND THERE WAS NONE AMONG HIS TRIBES WHO I STUMBLED. 38 EGYPT WAS GLAD WHEN THEY DE-1 PARTED, FOR DREAD OF THEM HAD FALLEN UP-1 ON IT. 39 HE SPREAD A CLOUD FOR A I COVERING, AND FIRE TO GIVE I LIGHT BY NIGHT. 40 THEY ASKED, AND HE I BROUGHT QUAIL, AND GAVE THEM BREAD FROM HEAVEN IN A-1 BUNDANCE. 43 HE OPENED THE ROCK, AND WATER I GUSHED OUT IT FLOWED THROUGH THE DESERT LIKE A I RIVER. 42 FOR HE REMEMBERED HIS HOLY I PROMISE, AND ABRAHAM, HIS I SERVANT. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 4 SO HE BROUGHT HIS PEOPLE I OUT WITH JOY, HIS CHOSEN ONES WITH I SINGING. 44 AND HE GAVE THEM THE LANDS OF THE I NATIONS, AND THEY TOOK POSSESSION OF THE FRUIT OF THE I PEOPLES TOIL, 45 THAT THEY MIGHT KEEP HIS I STATUTES AND OBSERVE HIS LAWS. I PRAISE THE LORD! PRAYER LET US WORSHIP THE LORD, OUR GOD, AND GIVE THANKS UNTO HIS HOLY NAME, BECAUSE HE HAS AWAKENED UNTO US THE PROPHET LIKE UNTO MOSES, BY WHOM WE ARE DELIVERED OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF DARKNESS, AND ARE MADE HEIRS OF EVERLASTING LIGHT. PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN. PSALM 106 R HE 106TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS IN WHICH THE PSALMIST ACKNOWLEDGES ALL THE SINS THAT THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL HAD COMMITTED AGAINST GOD, BY WHICH THEY HAD MADE THEM SELVES UNWORTHY FOR ALL HIS GRACE AND BLESSINGS. THEREFORE, IT SAYS CONSTANTLY THAT GOD HAS DONE ALL THESE THINGS FOR HIS NAMES SAKE AND FOR THE REMEMBRANCE OF HIS COVENANT. MOSES ALSO SAYS THIS (DEUTERONOMY 9:6), THEREFORE THEY CANNOT GLORY IN THEMSELVES EXCEPT IN HIS GRACE ALONEAS WE ALSO CAN HAVE NO OTHER GLORY. |06 1 PRAISE THE LORD! OH GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD, FOR I HE IS GOOD, FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOR-1 EVER! PSAJM 106 2 WHO CAN UTTER THE MIGHTY DEEDS I OF THE LORD| OR DECLARE I ALL HIS PRAISE? 3 BLESSED ARE THEY WHO OBSERVE I JUSTICE| WHO DO RIGHTEOUSNESS I AT ALL TIMES!  REMEMBER ME, O LORD, WHEN YOU SHOW FAVOR TO YOUR I PEOPLE|' HELP ME WHEN YOU I SAVE THEM, 3 THAT 1 MAY LOOK UPON THE PROSPERITY OF YOUR CHOSEN ONES, THAT I MAY REJOICE IN THE GLADNESS OF YOUR I NATION, THAT I MAY GLORY WITH YOUR IN- I HERITANCE. 6 BOTH WE AND OUR FATHERS I HAVE SINNED| WE HAVE COMMITTED INIQUITY WE HAVE DONE ! WICKEDNESS. 7 OUR FATHERS, WHEN THEY WERE IN EGYPT, DID NOT CONSIDER YOUR I WONDROUS WORKS| THEY DID NOT REMEMBER THE ABUNDANCE OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE, BUT REBELLED BY THE SEA, AT THE I RED SEA. 8 YET HE SAVED THEM FOR HIS I NAMES SAKE| THAT HE MIGHT MAKE KNOWN HIS I MIGHTY POWER. 9 HE REBUKED THE RED SEA, AND IT BE- I CAME DRY| AND HE LED THEM THROUGH THE DEEP AS THROUGH A I DESERT. 10 SO HE SAVED THEM FROM THE HAND I OF THE FOE  AND REDEEMED THEM FROM THE POWER OF THE I ENEMY. 11 AND THE WATERS COVERED THEIR ADVER- I SARIES  NOT ONE OF I THEM WAS LEFT. '2 THEN THEY BE-1 LIEVED HIS WORDS| THEY I SANG HIS PRAISE. 13 BUT THEY SOON FOR- I GOT HIS WORKS| THEY DID NOT WAIT FOR HIS I COUNSEL. RHADING THH PSALMS WITH LUTHFCR 14 BUT THEY HAD A WANTON CRAVING IN THE I WILDERNESS, AND PUL GOD TO THE TEST IN THE I DESERT 15 HE GAVE THEM I WHAT THEY ASKED, BUT SENT A WASTING DISEASE A- I MONG THEM. PR A YER GOOD, O LORD, HAVE BEEN YOUR THOUGHTS AND GREAT YOUR LOVING-KINDNESS TOWARD US. GRANT US YOUR SPIRIT TO WORK IN US, HEARTS THAT KNOW AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR MERCIES, AND WITHDRAW NOT YOUR HAND FROM US. DO NOT REMEMBER OUR INGRATITUDE AND UNWORTHINESS, BUT REMEMBER THE GRACE YOU HAVE PROMISED TO SINNERS IN YOUR SON, JESUS CHRIST, OUR LORD. AMEN. 16 WHEN MEN IN THE CAMP WERE JEALOUS OF I MOSES AND AARON, THE HOLY ONE I OF THE LORD, 17 THE EARTH OPENED AND SWALLOWED UP I DATHAN, AND COVERED THE COMPANY OF I ABIRAM. 18 FIRE ALSO BROKE OUT IN THEIR I COMPANY THE FLAME BURNED UP THE I WICKED. 19 THEY MADE A CALF IN I HOREB AND WORSHIPED A METAL I IMAGE. 20 THEY EXCHANGED THE GLO- I RY OF GOD FOR THE IMAGE OF AN OX THAT I EATS GRASS. 21 THEY FORGOT GOD, THEIR I SAVIOR, WHO HAD DONE GREAT THINGS IN I EGYPT, 22 WONDROUS WORKS IN THE I LAND OF HAM, AND AWESOME DEEDS BY THE I RED SEA. 23 THEREFORE HE SAID HE WOULD DE- I STROY THEM HAD NOT MOSES, HIS CHOSEN ONE, STOOD IN THE BREACH BEFORE HIM, TO TURN AWAY HIS WRATH FROM DE- I STROYING THEM. PSALM 106 PR A YER O LORD, TEACH US TO PROFIT BY THE EXAMPLES THAT WERE WRIT TEN FOR OUR WARNING, THE PUNISHMENTS WHICH YOU VISITED ON YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL BECAUSE OF THEIR SINS. ENLIGHTEN OUR EYES TO SEE THE ABOMINATION OF SIN, THAT WE MAY DREAD YOUR AVENG ING JUSTICE, MAY STRIVE TO AVOID ALL MANNER OF EVIL, AND MAY FLEE TO THE CROSS OF CHRIST, THE ONLY REFUGE FOR THE SOUL. AMEN. 24 THEN THEY DESPISED THE I PLEASANT LAND, HAVING NO FAITH IN HIS I PROMISE. 25 THEY MURMURED I IN THEIR TENTS, AND DID NOT OBEY THE VOICE I OF THE LORD. 26 THEREFORE HE RAISED HIS HAND AND I SWORE TO THEM THAT HE WOULD MAKE THEM FALL IN THE I WILDERNESS, 27 AND WOULD MAKE THEIR OFFSPRING FALL AMONG THE I NATIONS, SCATTERING THEM A- I MONG THE LANDS. 28 THEN THEY YOKED THEMSELVES TO THE BAAL I OF PEOR, AND ATE SACRIFICES OFFERED I TO THE DEAD 29 THEY PROVOKED THE LORD TO ANGER I WITH THEIR DEEDS, AND A PLAGUE BROKE OUT A- I MONG THEM. 30 THEN PHINEHAS STOOD UP AND I INTERVENED, AND THE I PLAGUE WAS STAYED. 31 AND THAT WAS COUNTED TO HIM AS I RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION FOR- I EVER. 32 THEY ANGERED HIM AT THE WATERS OF I MERIBAH, AND IT WENT ILL WITH MOSES ON I THEIR ACCOUNT, 33 FOR THEY MADE HIS SPIRIT I BITTER, AND HE SPOKE RASHLY I WITH HIS LIPS. 34 THEY DID NOT DESTROY THE I PEOPLES, AS THE LORD COM- I MANDED THEM. READING THE PSAI.MS WITH LUTHER 35 BUI THEY MIXED WITH THE I NATIONS AND LEARNED TO DO I AS THEY DID. 36 THEY SERVED THEIR I IDOLS, WHICH BECAME A I SNARE TO THEM. 37 THEY SACRIFICED I THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS TO THE I DEMONS 38 THEY POURED OUT INNOCENT BLOOD, THE BLOOD OF THEIR SONS AND I DAUGHTERS, WHOM THEY SACRIFICED TO THE IDOLS OF CANAAN, AND THE LAND WAS POLLUTED I WITH BLOOD. 39 THUS THEY BECAME UNCLEAN I BY THEIR ACTS, AND PLAYED THE WHORE I IN THEIR DEEDS. 40 THEN THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST HIS I PEOPLE, AND HE ABHORRED HIS I HERITAGE 41 HE GAVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF THE I NATIONS, SO THAT THOSE WHO HATED THEM RULED I OVER THEM. 42 THEIR ENEMIES OP- I PRESSED THEM, AND THEY WERE BROUGHT INTO SUBJECTION UN-1 DER THEIR POWER. 43 MANY TIMES HE DE- I LIVERED THEM, BUT THEY WERE REBELLIOUS IN THEIR PURPOSES AND WERE BROUGHT LOW THROUGH THEIR IN-1 IQUITY. 44 NEVERTHELESS, HE LOOKED UPON I THEIR DISTRESS, WHEN HE I HEARD THEIR CRY. 45 FOR THEIR SAKE HE REMEMBERED HIS I COVENANT, AND RELENTED ACCORDING TO THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS I STEADFAST LOVE. 46 HE CAUSED THEM TO BE I PITIED BY ALL THOSE WHO HELD THEM I CAPTIVE. 47 SAVE US, O LORD OUR GOD, AND GATHER US FROM AMONG THE I NATIONS, THAT WE MAY GIVE THANKS TO YOUR HOLY NAME AND GLORY I IN YOUR PRAISE. PSALM 107 48 BLESSED BE THE LORD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL, FROM EVERLASTING TO EVER-1 LASTING! AND LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY, AMEN! I PRAISE THE LORD! PR AYER LORD JESUS, WE GIVE YOU MOST HEARTY THANKS BECAUSE YOU HAVE REVEALED TO US THE SAVING TRUTH OF YOUR GOSPEL. GRANT US GRACE TO CONTINUE IN YOUR WORD, THAT WE WALK NOT AFTER OUR OWN THOUGHTS, BUT WORSHIP YOU IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH. PRESERVE YOUR WORD FOR OUR CHILDREN, THAT THEY MAY WALK IN YOUR WAYS AND REMAIN YOUR PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. AMEN. R  HE 107TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS FOR THE HELP THAT GOD SHOWS TO ALL PEOPLE IN THEIR DISTRESS, WHETHER THEY ARE GENTILE OR JEW. THIS HELP THE HEATHEN HAVE SOUGHT BY VARIOUS IDOLS AND WE CHRISTIANS AND THE HEATHEN HAVE SOUGHT BY VARIOUS SAINTS UP UNTIL NOW (AND TO A GREAT EXTENT STILL DO): FOR EXAMPLE, ST. LEONARD HAS RELEASED THE PRISONERS, ST. BASTIAN DELIVERS FROM PESTILENCE, ST. GEORGE PROTECTS IN BATTLE, ST. ERASMUS MAKES ONE RICH, AND ST. CHRISTOPHER HAS BECOME THE GOD OF SEA AND WATER. WE HAVE THUS DIVIDED ALL OF GODS HELP AMONG THE SAINTS, AS THE HEATHEN AMONG THEIR IDOLS, AND HAVE STOLEN AND ROBBED FROM GODTO WHOM ALONE THIS PSALM IS DEDICATED AND TO WHOM ALONE THE PSALM CALLS ON US TO THANK. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER |C?7 1 OH GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD, FOR I HE IS GOOD, FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOR-1 EVER! 2 LET THE REDEEMED OF THE LORD I SAY SO, WHOM HE HAS REDEEMED FROM I TROUBLE 3 AND GATHERED IN I FROM THE LANDS, FROM THE EAST AND FROM THE WEST, FROM THE NORTH AND I FROM THE SOUTH. 4 SOME WANDERED IN I DESERT WASTES, FINDING NO WAY TO A CITY TO I DWELL IN 5 HUNGRY AND I THIRSTY, THEIR SOUL FAINTED WITH-1 IN THEM. 6 THEN THEY CRIED TO THE LORD IN THEIR I TROUBLE, AND HE DELIVERED THEM FROM I THEIR DISTRESS. 7 HE LED THEM BY A I STRAIGHT WAY TILL THEY REACHED A CITY TO I DWELL IN. 8 LET THEM THANK THE LORD FOR HIS I STEADFAST LOVE, FOR HIS WONDROUS WORKS TO THE CHIL-1 DREN OF MEN! 9 FOR HE SATISFIES THE I LONGING SOUL, AND THE HUNGRY SOUL HE FILLS I WITH GOOD THINGS. 10 SOME SAT IN DARKNESS AND IN THE SHAD-1 OW OF DEATH, PRISONERS IN AFFLICTION I AND IN IRONS, 11 FOR THEY HAD REBELLED AGAINST THE I WORDS OF GOD, AND SPUMED THE COUNSEL OF THE I MOST HIGH. 12 SO HE BOWED THEIR HEARTS DOWN WITH HARD I LABOR THEY FELL DOWN, WITH I NONE TO HELP. 13 THEN THEY CRIED TO THE LORD IN THEIR I TROUBLE, AND HE DELIVERED THEM FROM I THEIR DISTRESS. 14 HE BROUGHT THEM OUT OF DARKNESS AND THE SHAD-1 OW OF DEATH, AND BURST THEIR I BONDS APART.

AMEN.  6 | READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 108 108TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS, WITH WORDS ALMOST LIKE PSALM 60, IN WHICH THE PSALMIST GIVES THANKS FOR GODS KINGDOM. ALREADY IN THE FIRST VERSE, THE PSALM EXALTS THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST AND PRAYS THAT GOD WILL ESTABLISH HIS KINGDOM IN ALL THE WORLD AND ACCORDINGLY BRING DAVIDS KINGDOM TO ITS PROPER, FINAL, FULL STATION. FOR DAVID HAD ONLY A SLIGHT, PARTIAL PIECE (COMPARED TO THE WHOLE WORLD) OF THAT WHICH WAS PROMISED TO COME TO HIM. AS ISAIAH 9:7 ALSO SAYS, HE WILL REIGN ON THE THRONE OF DAVID AND OVER HIS KINGDOM. |AS 1 MY HEART IS STEADFAST, I O GOD! 1 WILL SING AND MAKE MELODY WITH ALL MY I BEING! 2 AWAKE, OI HARP AND LYRE!

SO GOVERN US BY YOUR SPIRIT THAT WE ALWAYS REMAIN CITIZENS IN YOUR KINGDOM OF GRACE, AND WHEN OUR EARTHLY PILGRIMAGE IS ENDED, RECEIVE US INTO YOUR KINGDOM OF GLORY, THAT WITH ALL THE HOSTS OF HEAVEN WE MAY FOREVER MAGNIFY YOUR HOLY NAME. AMEN. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PSALM 109 C|HE 109TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER, PRAYED IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST AGAINST JUDAS, HIS BETRAYER, AND AGAINST THE JEWS, HIS CRUCIFIERS. IN ACTS 1:20 ST. PETER APPLIED THIS PSALM TO JUDAS WHEN THEY WERE SELECTING MATTHIAS TO REPLACE HIM. HE DID NOT MEAN TO SAY THAT THE PSALM SPEAKS ONLY ABOUT JUDAS.... THE PSALM BEGINS WITH JUDAS AND THEN EXTENDS TO EVERYONE OF JUDAS' ILK, TO ALL SCHISMATICS AND PERSECUTORS OF THE WORD OF CHRIST FOR THEY ALWAYS SLANDER THE TRUTH AND PERSECUTE THE GENUINE CHRISTIANS. (FROM LUTHERS COMMENTARY ON THE FOUR PSALMS OF COMFORT, LUTHER'S WORKS 14:257) CHRIST HIMSELF COMPLAINS OF THESE MATTERS IN PSALM 109:2. . .. FOR THUS THE ENEMIES OF THE TRUTH ARE ACCUSTOMED TO OBSCURE, TRADUCE, AND CORRUPT THE FRUITS AND GAINS OF THE GOSPEL AND OF SALVATION AMONG SIMPLE AND GODLY HEARERS... . (THESE ENEMIES ADOM THEMSELVES WITH FALSE AND COUNTER FEIT PRAISES BUT THEY DEFAME US, IN ORDER TO MAKE US MORE OBNOXIOUS TO THOSE WHO ARE STRANGERS TO OUR DOCTRINE. (FROM LUTHERS LECTURES ON GENESIS 39:13-15, LUTHERS WORKS 7:92) |&9  BE NOT SILENT, O GOD I OF MY PRAISE! 2 FOR WICKED AND DECEITFUL MOUTHS ARE OPENED AGAINST ME, SPEAKING AGAINST ME WITH I LYING TONGUES. 3 THEY ENCIRCLE ME WITH I WORDS OF HATE, AND ATTACK ME I WITHOUT CAUSE. 4 IN RETURN FOR MY LOVE THEY AC-1 CUSE ME, BUT I GIVE MY-1 SELF TO PRAYER. 5 SO THEY REWARD ME E-1 VIL FOR GOOD, AND HATRED I FOR MY LOVE. 264 PSALM 109 PRAYER EXCELLENT, O LORD JESUS, IS YOUR LOVE WHICH YOU HAVE SHOWN TOWARD US IN THAT YOU CAME INTO OUR FLESH, AND SUF FERED SUCH CONTRADICTION OF SINNERS AGAINST YOURSELF. GRANT US A WILL SO CONFORMED TO YOUR WILL, THAT WE DO NOT FEAR THE HATRED AND THE MOCKERY OF THE WICKED, BUT SUFFERING RIDICULE PATIENTLY, FOLLOW YOU ALL THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES.

IS LET THEM BE BEFORE THE LORD CON-1 TINUALLY, THAT HE MAY CUT OFF THE MEMORY OF THEM I FROM THE EARTH! HEADING THE RSALMS WITH LUTHER 16 FOR HE DID NOT REMEMBER TO SHOW I KINDNESS BUT PURSUED THE POOR AND NEEDY AND THE BROKENHEARTED, TO PUT I THEM TO DEATH. 17 HE LOVED TO CURSE LET CURSES COME UP-1 ON HIM! HE DID NOT DELIGHT IN BLESSING MAY IT BE I FAR FROM HIM! 18 HE CLOTHED HIMSELF WITH CURSING I AS HIS COAT MAY IT SOAK INTO HIS BODY LIKE WATER, LIKE OIL IN-1 TO HIS BONES! 19 MAY IT BE LIKE A GARMENT THAT HE WRAPS A-1 ROUND HIM  LIKE A BELT THAT HE PUTS ON I EVRY DAY! 20 MAY THIS BE THE REWARD OF MY ACCUSERS I FROM THE LORD, OF THOSE WHO SPEAK EVIL A-1 GAINST MY LIFE! PRAYER O LORD JESUS, HOW DEEPLY WERE YOU HUMBLED SINCE YOU CONDESCENDED DAILY TO WALK WITH YOUR BETRAYER, THOUGH THE MALICE OF HIS HEART WAS NOT HID FROM YOU. SURELY YOU DESIRE THE SALVATION OF SINNERS. HAVE COMPASSION ON MY POOR SOUL, WASH IT WITH YOUR BLOOD, AND GRANT ME STRENGTH TO RESIST SIN, THAT I MAY OVERCOME AND INHERIT THE BLESSING.

PRAYER THANKS BE TO YOU, O LORD JESUS, FOR YOUR BITTER SUFFERING AND YOUR SHAMEFUL DEATH, BY WHICH YOU, AS A FAITHFUL HIGH PRIEST, HAVE PURCHASED US FROM THE CURSE OF THE LAW.

IN THE ENTIRE SCRIPTURE THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THIS PSALM. IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT AS THE CHIEF CONFIRMATION OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH. FOR NOWHERE ELSE IS CHRIST PROPHESIED WITH SUCH CLEAR, PLAIN WORDS AS A PRIEST AND AN ETERNAL PRIEST. IT IS PROPHESIED AS WELL THAT THE PRIESTHOOD OF AARON WOULD BE ABOLISHED. THIS PSALM IS YET AGAIN AND MORE SPLENDIDLY EXTOLLED IN THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS.

LIKE SEVERAL OTHER PSALMS ABOVE, IT SPEAKS OF THE DEEP SPIRITUAL AFFLICTION, OF WHICH FEW PEOPLE KNOW. HE LAMENTS IN THIS PSALM THAT THINGS ARE SO BAD, YET HE CONFESSES HIS FAITH AND THE TRUTH OF GOD. HE CALLS ALL HUMAN HOLINESS, VIRTUE, AND CONFIDENCE ONLY FALSEHOOD AND EMPTI NESS. THIS THE WORLD WILL NOT AND CANNOT HEAR NOR TOLERATE. THUS IT COMES THAT THE GODLY SUFFER, TREMBLE, AND FEAR ALL KINDS OF MISFORTUNE. BUT DESPITE ALL, HE IS COMFORTED BY THIS, THAT GODS WORD IS TRUE AND WILL ONLY MOTIVATE US THE MORE: THEY GIVE ME TO DRINK FROM THE CUP OF THEIR WRATH. ALL RIGHT, THEN 1 WILL TAKE THE CUP OF GRACE AND SALVATION AND DRINK MYSELF SPIRI TUALLY DRUNK AND (THROUGH PREACHING) POUR OUT FROM THIS CUP ON THOSE WHO WILL DRINK WITH ME AND WHO DRAW THEIR GRACE FROM THE WORD. THIS IS OUR CUP, AND WITH THIS CUP WE WILL WORSHIP GOD AND PRAISE HIS NAME. WE WILL FULFILL OUR VOWS, NAMELY THE FIRST COMMANDMENT, THAT WE RECEIVE HIM AS THE ONE GOD AND PRAISE HIM AS THE ONLY GOD WORTHY TO PREACH AND TO BE CALLED UPON. YOU FIND HERE ALSO THAT GIVING THANKS, PREACHING, AND CONFESSING GODS NAME BEFORE ALL PEOPLE IS THE TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD. 7 PSALM 116 ||6 1 1 LOVE THE LORD, BECAUSE I HE HAS HEARD MY VOICE AND MY PLEAS FOR I MERCY. 2 BECAUSE HE INCLINED HIS I EAR TO ME, THEREFORE 1 WILL CALL ON HIM AS LONG I AS I LIVE. 3 THE SNARES OF DEATH ENCOMPASSED ME THE PANGS OF SHEOL LAID I HOLD ON ME I SUFFERED DISTRESS AND I ANGUISH. 4 THEN I CALLED ON THE NAME I OF THE LORD: "O LORD, I PRAY, DELIV-1 ER MY SOUL! 5 GRACIOUS IS THE LORD, AND I RIGHTEOUS OUR GOD IS I MERCIFUL. 6 THE LORD PRESERVES THE I SIMPLE WHEN I WAS BROUGHT LOW, HE I SAVED ME. 7 RETURN, O MY SOUL, I TO YOUR REST FOR THE LORD HAS DEALT BOUNTIFULLY I WITH YOU. 8 FOR YOU HAVE DELIVERED MY I SOUL FROM DEATH, MY EYES FROM TEARS, MY FEET FROM I STUMBLING 9 1 WILL WALK BE-1 FORE THE LORD IN THE LAND OF THE I LIVING. 10 1 BELIEVED, EVEN I WHEN 1 SPOKE, 1 AM GREATLY AF-1 FLICTED N I SAID IN I MY ALARM, ALL MANKIND ARE I LIARS. 12 WHAT SHALL I RENDER I TO THE LORD FOR ALL HIS BENE-1 FITS TO ME? 13 1 WILL LIFT UP THE CUP OF SAL-1 VATION AND CALL ON THE NAME I OF THE LORD, 14 1 WILL PAY MY VOWS I TO THE LORD IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL HIS I PEOPLE.

IN THIS KINGDOM, NOTHING REIGNS BUT GRACE AND TRUTH, THAT IS, THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS, ETERNAL LIFE, AND ALL JOY AND COMFORT OVER SINS, DEATH, AND ALL EVIL. THIS PSALM IS ABUNDANTLY ENOUGH EXPLAINED IN OUR COMMENTARY. I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NOT ONE WHO TRULY KNOWS EVERYTHING THE HOLY SPIRIT SAYS IN THIS SHORT PSALM. IF THEY WERE FORCED TO TEACH OR INSTRUCT SOMEONE FROM IT, THEY PSALM 117 WOULD NOT KNOW AT WHICH END TO BEGIN. TO PUT THESE VICIOUS PEOPLE TO SHAME AND TO HONOR GODS WORD, I HAVE TAKEN IT UPON MYSELF TO INTERPRET THIS PSALM, SO THAT ONE MAY SEE HOW CLEAR GODS WORD IS, HOW SIMPLE, AND YET HOW ALTO GETHER .. . INEXHAUSTIBLE IN POWER AND VIRTUE. IT RENEWS AND REFRESHES THE HEART, RESTORING, RELIEVING, COMFORTING, AND STRENGTHENING US CONSTANTLY. LUTHER'S WORKS I4.8 ||? 1 PRAISE THE LORD, ALL I NATIONS!

HOW MUCH IS IT TO BE LAMENTED THAT, SEEK ING EVERYWHERE FOR GODS WORD AND BEING NOWHERE ABLE TO FIND IT, THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WOUND THEIR WAY TO IDOLS? AND WE CHRISTIANS DID THE SAME WITH OUR RUNNING TO PILGRIMAGES AND WINDING OUR WAY TO THE CLOISTER. BUT THE HOLY CHURCH IS OUR JERUSALEM, AND CHRIST IS OUR TEMPLE, CITY, ALTAR, AND MERCY SEAT, TO WHICH, FROM WHICH, AND WITH WHICH WE SEEK AND HEAR HIS WORD. 1 I WAS GLAD WHEN THEY I SAID TO ME, LET US GO TO THE HOUSE I OF THE LORD! 2 OUR FEET HAVE BEEN I STANDING WITHIN YOUR GATES, O JE- I RUSALEM! SOS READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 3 JERUSALEMBUILT AS A I CITY THAT IS BOUND FIRMLY TO-1 GETHER, 4 TO WHICH THE TRIBES GO UP, THE TRIBES OF THE LORD, AS WAS DECREED FOR I ISRAEL, TO GIVE THANKS TO THE NAME I OF THE LORD. 5 THERE THRONES FOR JUDG-1 MENT WERE SET, THE THRONES OF THE HOUSE OF I DAVID. 6 PRAY FOR THE PEACE OF JE-1 RUSALEM! "MAY THEY BE SECURE WHO I LOVE YOU! 7 PEACE BE WITH-1 IN YOUR WALLS AND SECURITY WITHIN YOUR I TOWERS!" 8 FOR MY BROTHERS AND COM-1 PANIONS SAKE" I WILL SAY, "PEACE BE WITH-1 IN YOU!" 9 FOR THE SAKE OF THE HOUSE OF THE I LORD OUR GOD, I WILL I SEEK YOUR GOOD. PR A YER OUR HEARTS ARE GLAD AND OUR SOULS REJOICE BEFORE YOU, LORD, OUR GOD, BECAUSE BY YOUR WORD OF TRUTH YOU HAVE MADE US MEMBERS OF YOUR HOLY CHURCH, IN WHICH YOU DAILY AND RICHLY FORGIVE THE SINS OF ALL THOSE WHO BUILD THEIR TRUST ON JESUS CHRIST. GRANT US GRACE TO ABIDE IN THE LOVE OF YOUR WORD, IN PURITY OF FAITH AND IN PIETY OF LIFE, EVEN TO OUR END. AMEN. 304 PSALM 123 G - PSALM 123 123RD PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER AGAINST THE ARROGANT AND THE PROUD WHO DESPISE AND SCORN GODS WORD AND HIS LITTLE ONES. NOT ONLY THE NATIONS CONSIDERED THE GOD AND WORSHIP OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TO BE A WORK OF FOOL ISHNESS, YES, EVEN ERROR AND SEDITION. EVEN AMONG THE ISRAELITES THEMSELVES, THE WORSHIPERS OF IDOLS AND FALSE GODS, THE FALSE TEACHERS WITH THEIR MULTITUDES, ALSO ARROGANT LY AND SECURELY DESPISED AND SCORNED THE LITTLE LAND AND THE TRUE TEACHING, AS PSALM 12 AND PSALM 14 ABOVE ALSO LAMENT. SO ALSO TODAY, OUR PRINCES AND REBELLIOUS SPIRITS (WHO ARE AS HOLY AS THE GOSPEL ITSELF) IN AN ENTIRELY PRINCELY AND PIOUS MANNER DESPISE THE POOR PREACHER AND THE FAITHFUL WOR SHIPER OF CHRIST AND TREAD THEM UNDERFOOTTO SAY NOTHING OF WHAT OUR HEATHEN, THE SPIRITUAL LORDS, DO, AS WELL AS THEIR MULTITUDES. WE THEREFORE ARE COVERED EVERYWHERE WITH CON TEMPT. BUT GOD IS AND WILL BE GRACIOUS. AMEN. 1 TO YOU I LIFT I UP MY EYES, O YOU WHO ARE ENTHRONED IN THE I HEAVENS! 2 BEHOLD, AS THE EYES OF SERVANTS LOOK TO THE HAND OF THEIR MASTER, AS THE EYES OF A MAIDSERVANT TO THE HAND OF HER I MISTRESS, SO OUR EYES LOOK TO THE LORD OUR GOD, TILL HE HAS MERCY UP-1 ON US. 3 HAVE MERCY UPON US, O LORD, HAVE MERCY UP- I ON US| FOR WE HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH I OF CONTEMPT. 4 OUR SOUL HAS HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH OF THE SCOM OF THOSE WHO I ARE AT EASE| OF THE CONTEMPT I OF THE PROUD. 3&S READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PRA YER LORD JESUS, SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF YOUR FATHER, A LORD OVER HEAVEN AND EARTH, RESTRAIN THE ENEMIES OF YOUR CHURCH, AND UPHOLD YOUR FAITHFUL FOLLOWERS. LET NOT THE SCORN OF THE WORLD AND THE MOCKERY OF THE PROUD CAUSE US TO FALL AWAY FROM YOU, BUT GRANT US COURAGE TO CONFESS YOUR NAME UNTO OUR END, AND CAUSE THE WICKED TO SEE YOUR POWER AND THE UPRIGHT TO SEE YOUR TRUTH. AMEN. PSALM 124 HE 124TH PSALM IS A PSALM THANKING GOD FOR PRO TECTING HIS POOR LITTLE BAND FROM THE RUTHLESS TYRANTS. HE RES CUES THEM FROM THE SNARES OF THE POISONOUS SLANDERER. THESE ARE AS MANY AND GREAT AS A GREAT, DEEP WATER AND FLOOD AGAINST THE LITTLE BAND. BUT THOUGH THEIR TEETH BE EVER SO MALEVOLENT AND ANGRY, GOD IS GREATER AND KNOCKS THEIR TEETH OUT AND BREAKS THE SNARES AND RESCUES HIS OWN FROM THEM, AS WE STILL DAILY EXPERIENCE. 624  IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THE LORD WHO WAS I ON OUR SIDE LET ISRAEL I NOW SAY 2 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN THE LORD WHO WAS I ON OUR SIDE WHEN PEOPLE ROSE UP A-1 GAINST US, 3 THEN THEY WOULD HAVE SWALLOWED US I UP ALIVE, WHEN THEIR ANGER WAS KINDLED A-1 GAINST US 4 THEN THE FLOOD WOULD HAVE SWEPT I US AWAY, THE TORRENT WOULD HAVE GONE I OVER US PSALM 125 5 THEN OVER US I WOULD HAVE GONE' THE RAGING I WATERS. 6 BLESSED I BE THE LORD| WHO HAS NOT GIVEN US AS PREY I TO THEIR TEETH! 7 WE HAVE ESCAPED LIKE A BIRD FROM THE SNARE OF THE I FOWLERS " THE SNARE IS BROKEN, AND WE I HAVE ESCAPED! 8 OUR HELP IS IN THE NAME I OF THE LORD, WHO MADE I HEAVEN AND EARTH. PRAYER PRAISE BELONGS TO YOU, LORD GOD, BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MIGHTILY PRESERVED YOUR CHURCH AGAINST HER ENEMIES, BOTH VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE, THAT THE VERY GATES OF HELL COULD NOT PRE VAIL AGAINST HER. DEFEND US AGAINST ALL EVIL, AND PRESERVE US AND OUR CHILDREN IN THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF YOU AND OF OUR SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST, WHOM YOU HAVE SENT, THAT IN HIM WE MAY HAVE LIFE. AMEN. PSALM 125 'HE 125TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS. IT GIVES THANKS THAT GOD WILL NOT FOREVER TOLERATE THE POWER OF THE UNGODLY TEACHERS AND OFFICIALS OVER THOSE WHO TRULY BELIEVE, TEACH, AND HOPE IN HIM. THEREFORE, THE CHRISTIAN NEED NOT BE WEARY AND FOR THAT REASON FALL AWAY FROM THE WORD, BUT HE WOULD GIVE ALL BLESSINGS TO THOSE WHO HOPE IN HIM. HOWEVER, GOD WILL CUT OFF AND THROW OUT THE FAITHLESS WITH THEIR CROOKED WAYSTHE MASTER AS WELL AS THE STUDENT. WE HAVE SEEN AND EXPERIENCED THIS ALSO IN OUR OWN TIME AMONG THE REBELLIOUS SPIRITS. E 907 KHADING THH PSALMS WITH LUTHLR 1 THOSE WHO TRUST IN THE LORD ARE LIKE MOUNT I ZION, WHICH CANNOT BE MOVED, BUT ABIDES FOR-1 EVER. 2 AS THE MOUNTAINS SURROUND JERUSALEM, SO THE LORD SURROUNDS HIS I PEOPLE, FROM THIS LIME FORTH AND FOR- I EVERMORE. J FOR THE SCEPTER OF WICKEDNESS SHALL NOT REST ON THE LAND ALLOTTED TO THE I RIGHTEOUS, LEST THE RIGHTEOUS STRETCH OUT THEIR HANDS TO I DO WRONG. 4 DO GOOD, O LORD, TO THOSE I WHO ARE GOOD, AND TO THOSE WHO ARE UPRIGHT I IN THEIR HEARTS! 5 BUT THOSE WHO TURN ASIDE TO THEIR CROOKED WAYS THE LORD WILL LEAD AWAY WITH EVIL- 1 DOERS! PEACE BE UPON I ISRAEL! PR A YER O LORD, WHO DID NOT FORSAKE YOUR PEOPLE, WHO PROTECTED ZION WITH AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM, AND DEFENDED JERUSALEM WITH A MIGHTY HAND, RESTRAIN THE WICKED, CONVERT THE SINNERS, TURN THE HEARTS OF OUR ENEMIES, COVER US WITH THE SHADOW OF YOUR WINGS, SAVE YOUR CHURCH IN THESE PERILOUS TIMES, AND ALWAYS GRANT US THE ENJOYMENT OF YOUR PEACE IN JESUS, OUR SAVIOR. AMEN. PSALM 126 PSALM 126 NE 126IH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS FOR THE DELIV ERANCE FROM THE CAPTIVITY IN BABYLON. WHETHER IT WAS MADE FOLLOWING THAT CAPTIVITY OR PRIOR TO IT (AS A PROPHECY FOR THE COMFORT AND HOPE FOR THE COMING DELIVERANCE, SO THAT THEY MAY NOT DESPAIR) IS OF NO CONCERN. AT THE END THE PSALMIST CONCLUDES THAT IT HAPPENSAND ALWAYS HAPPENSTO THE SAINTS THAT THEY FIRST SUFFER BEFORE THEY CAN REJOICE. SIMILARLY, THE WORLD FIRST REJOICES BEFORE THEY GET THEIR SUF FERING. THEREFORE, THE SAINTS SOW WITH TEARS TO REAP AFTERWARD WITH JOY. BUT (HE SAYS), SUCH SEED IS EXCELLENT AND PRECIOUS SEED TO BRING FORTH SUCH A FRUIT. BEFORE WEEPING, ONE CANNOT SEE THAT IT IS SO PRECIOUS AND WORTHY BEFORE GOD. BUT GOD LOVES HIS SAINTS SO MUCH THAT HE REGARDS EVEN THEIR DEATH (WHICH IS TRULY THE MOST ABOMINABLE, ACCURSED SEED OF THE WORLD) AS MORE PRECIOUS THAN ALL OF THE WORLDS TREASURES AND GOODS. 426 1 WHEN THE LORD RESTORED THE FORTUNES OF I ZION, WE WERE LIKE I THOSE WHO DREAM. 2 THEN OUR MOUTH WAS FILLED WITH I LAUGHTER, AND OUR TONGUE WITH I SHOUTS OF JOY THEN THEY SAID AMONG THE NATIONS, THE LORD HAS DONE GREAT 1 THINGS FOR THEM. 3 THE LORD HAS DONE GREAT THINGS FOR US I WE ARE GLAD. 4 RESTORE OUR FORTUNES, I O LORD, LIKE STREAMS IN THE I NEGEB! 309 RHADINC THFC PSAL.MS WITH LLJTHFCR S THOSE WHO I SOW IN TEARS 1 ' SHALL REAP WITH I SHOUTS OF JOY! 6 HE WHO GOES OUT WEEPING, BEARING THE SEED FOR I SOWING| SHALL COME HOME WITH SHOUTS OF JOY, BRINGING HIS I SHEAVES WITH HIM. PRAYKR MERCIFUL FATHER IN HEAVEN, CONVERT THE SINNERS AND COM FORT YOUR BELIEVERS WITH YOUR WORD AND SPIRIT. GRANT US WILL ING HEARTS AND UNDERSTANDING MINDS TO SOW THE SEED OF YOUR WORD BROADCAST AMONG MEN, AND IF IT SEEMS GOOD TO HIDE THE FRUIT OF OUR SOWING FROM OUR EYES, STRENGTHEN OUR HEARTS THAT WE FAINT NOT, BUT WAIT FOR THE HARVEST IN THE WORLD TO COME, THROUGH JESUS CHNST, OUR LORD. AMEN. PSALM 127 HE 127TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION. IT TEACH ES US THAT WORLDLY AUTHORITY AND HOUSEHOLD ORDER ARE NOTH ING LESS THAN GODS GIFTS AND REST ONLY IN HIS HAND. FOR WHERE HE DOES NOT GIVE PEACE AND GOOD GOVERNMENT, THERE NO WISDOM, ORDER, EXERTION, OR ARMOR CAN HOLD ONTO PEACE. WHERE HE DOES NOT GIVE GOOD FORTUNE, WITH WIFE, CHILDREN, AND WORKERS, THERE ALL CARE AND WORK WILL BE FOR NOTHING. 627 1 UNLESS THE LORD BUILDS THE HOUSE, THOSE WHO BUILD IT LA-1 BOR IN VAIN. UNLESS THE LORD WATCHES OVER THE CITY, THE WATCHMAN STAYS A-1 WAKE IN VAIN. 3J0 PSALM 128 2 IT IS IN VAIN THAT YOU RISE UP EARLY AND GO LATE TO REST, EATING THE BREAD OF I ANXIOUS TOIL FOR HE GIVES TO HIS BE- I LOV&D SLEEP. 3 BEHOLD, CHILDREN ARE A HERITAGE I FROM THE LORD, THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB I A REWARD. 4 LIKE ARROWS IN THE HAND OF A I WARRIOR ARE THE CHILDREN I OF ONES YOUTH. 5 BLESSDD IS THE MAN WHO FILLS HIS QUIVER I WITH THEM! HE SHALL NOT BE PUT TO SHAME WHEN HE SPEAKS WITH HIS ENEMIES I IN THE GATE. PRAYER FOR THE BENEFIT OF MAN. YOU, FATHER OF MERCIES, INSTITUTED HOLY WEDLOCK, AND HAVE PROMISED YOUR BLESSING TO EVERY HOUSE IN WHICH DWELLS YOUR FEAR. YES, EVEN YOU SIT AT THE FIRE SIDE OF THEM THAT LOVE YOU, AS AT YOUR OWN HEARTH AND HOME. CAUSE YOUR PEACE TO DWELL UNDER OUR ROOF, AND BLESS THE LABORS OF OUR HANDS. AMEN. PSALM 128 F HE 128TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF COMFORT IN WHICH THE ESTATE OF MARRIAGE IS SPLENDIDLY PRAISED. MARRIAGE PARTNERS ARE GIVEN THIS GREAT COMFORT: THEY SHOULD NOT LOOK ONLY AT THE TROUBLE, WORK, DISCOURAGEMENT, AND DISCOMFORT THEY FEEL AND EXPERIENCE IN MARRIAGE, BUT RATHER LOOK AT THE GRACIOUS WILL OF GOD TOWARD THEM, THAT THEIR STATION AND LIFE ARE A GRA CIOUS CREATION OF GOD AND ARE BLESSED BY HIM. THEREFORE, MARRIAGE IS DEAR TO HIM, AND HE GIVES IT MUCH MORE HAPPI NESS AND BLESSING THAN DISCOMFORT, IF ONE ONLY BELIEVES AND  9 || READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER ADAPTS ONESELF TO MARRIAGE AND FAITHFULLY REMAINS WITHIN IT. THUS IN THE BEGINNING AND MIDDLE OF THE PSALM IT SAYS, EVERYONE WHO FEARS THE LORD . .  WHEN THE GODLESS GO ASTRAY, ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS NO SURPRISE. 1 BLESSED IS EVERYONE WHO I FEARS THE LORD, WHO WALKS I IN HIS WAYS! 2 YOU SHALL EAT THE FRUIT OF THE LABOR I OF YOUR HANDS YOU SHALL BE BLESSED, AND IT SHALL BE I WELL WITH YOU. 1 YOUR WIFE WILL BE LIKE A FRUITFUL VINE WITH-1 IN YOUR HOUSE YOUR CHILDREN WILL BE LIKE OLIVE SHOOTS AROUND YOUR I TABLE. 4 BEHOLD, THUS SHALL THE I MAN BE BLESSED WHO I FEARS THE LORD. 5 THE LORD BLESS YOU FROM I ZION! MAY YOU SEE THE PROSPERITY OF JERUSALEM ALL THE DAYS I OF YOUR LIFE! 6 MAY YOU SEE YOUR CHILDRENS I CHILDREN! PEACE BE UPON I ISRAEL! PRAYER THANKS BE TO YOU, OUR GOD, FOR INSTITUTING THE HOLY ESTATE OF MATRIMONY AND PRESERVING IT FOR SO MANY AGES AGAINST THE ASSAULTS OF THAT APOSTATE SPIRIT WHICH IS AN ENEMY OF ALL THAT IS PURE AND GODLY. MAKE EVERY HOUSE YOUR TEMPLE. FASHION THE HEARTS OF HUSBAND AND WIFE TO LOVE CHILDREN, AND CAUSE BOTH PARENTS AND CHILDREN TO WALK IN THE FAITH OF YOUR SON, AND BE SAVED. AMEN. 3K2 PSALM 129 PSALM 129 R 129TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS IN WHICH THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL GIVE THANKS FOR THE MANY DELIVERANCES THAT GOD HAS OFTEN DONE FOR THEM SINCE THE BEGINNING. THE BOOKS OF JUDGES AND OF KINGS SHOW HOW OFTEN THEY WERE OPPRESSED BY THE NATIONS. THEY OPPRESSED THEM SEVERELY FOR A LONG TIME AND PLOWED LONG FURROWS ON THEIR BACK. THEY BURDENED THEM WITH YOKE AND FETTERS UNTIL GOD RAISED UP A DELIVERER FOR THEM TO FREE THEM FROM THEIR PLOWS, YOKES, AND ROPES. AT THE END THE PSALMIST WISHES FOR ISRAEL (THAT IS, PROPHESIES OF THEM) THAT ALL THEIR ENEMIES WOULD BE DRIED UP AND WITHERED, WHICH THEN WAS DONE. FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLES ARE GONE ISRAEL ALONE REMAINS. THUS ALL THE HEATHEN AND ENEMIES OF CHRIST ARE LIKE THE GRASS ON THE ROOF THAT SPROUTS AND GROWS AS THOUGH IT WILL PRODUCE MUCH. BUT IT WITHERS BEFORE IT IS FULLY DEVELOPED. IT BRINGS NO FRUIT, AND THERE IS NO BLESSING IN IT. THIS THEN IS THE LEGACY OF THE HEATHEN, HERETIC, AND OTHER ENEMIES, THAT AFTER THEY RAGE AND STORM THEY ULTIMATELY VANISH, LEAVING NEITHER SEED NOR MARK BEHIND THEM. THE CHRISTIANS, HOWEVER, REMAIN FOREVER AND EVER. |9 1 GREATLY HAVE THEY AFFLICTED ME I FROM MY YOUTH LET ISRAEL I NOW SAY 2 GREATLY HAVE THEY AFFLICTED ME I FROM MY YOUTH, YET THEY HAVE NOT PREVAILED A-1 GAINST ME. 3 THE PLOWERS PLOWED UP-1 ON MY BACK THEY MADE LONG THEIR I FURROWS. 4 THE LORD IS I RIGHTEOUS HE HAS CUT THE CORDS OF THE I WICKED. S|R? READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 5 MAY ALL WHO HATE I ZION BE PUT TO SHAME AND TURNED I BACKWARD! 6 LET THEM BE LIKE THE GRASS ON THE I HOUSETOPS, WHICH WITHERS BEFORE IT I GROWS UP, 7 WITH WHICH THE REAPER DOES NOT I FILL HIS HAND NOR THE BINDER OF I SHEAVES HIS ARMS, 8 NOR DO THOSE WHO PASS BY SAY, THE BLESSING OF THE LORD BE UP- 1 ON YOU! WE BLESS YOU IN THE NAME I OF THE LORD! PRAYER THANKS BE TO YOU, LORD JESUS CHRIST, WHO HAS TRIUMPHED OVER YOUR AND OUR ENEMIES, AND HAS CUT ASUNDER OUR BONDS. BE WITH US ON THE DAY OF TRIAL, PRESERVE US IN THE FAITH, UPHOLD US IN THE STRIFE, GRANT US THE VICTORY, AND MAKE US TO TRIUMPH WITH ALL YOUR SAINTS. AMEN. PSALM 130 HE 130TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER THAT COMES FROM THE GENUINE DAVIDIC DEVOTION AND UNDERSTANDING. IT CONFESSES THAT BEFORE GOD NO ONE IS RIGHTEOUS, NOR MAY ONE BECOME RIGHTEOUS BY HIS OWN WORK AND RIGHTEOUSNESS, BUT ONLY THROUGH GRACE AND FORGIVENESS OF SINS, WHICH GOD HAS PROMISED. THE PSALMIST COMFORTS HIMSELF AS HE RELIES ON THIS PROMISE AND WORD. HE EXHORTS ALL OF ISRAEL THAT THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME AND LEARN THAT WITH GOD IS A THRONE OF GRACE AND REDEMPTION. THROUGH HIM ALONE AND NO WAY ELSE SHALL ISRAEL BE FREED OF SINS, THAT IS, THROUGH FORGIVENESS" (WITH OUT WHICH THERE IS NO GRACE) BECOME RIGHTEOUS AND BLESSED. APART FROM THIS, HE TRULY WOULD BE IN THE DEPTHS AND WOULD NEVER STAND BEFORE GOD.  3|4 PSALM 130 LOOK! THE TRUE MASTER AND DOCTOR OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES IS THE ONE WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT THIS MEANS: THE SEED OF THE WOMAN SHALL TREAD ON THE HEAD OF THE SERPENT (GENESIS 3:15), AND THROUGH THIS SEED ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD SHALL BE BLESSED (GENESIS 12:30). THEREFORE, THE PSALMIST PLACES BOTH A PROMISE AND A PROPHECY OF CHRIST IN THIS VERSE: HE WILL REDEEM ISRAEL FROM ALL HIS INIQUITIES. UPON THIS VERSE, AND FROM IT, COMES THE ENTIRE PSALM. |SC? 1 OUT I OF THE DEPTHS I CRY TO YOU, I O LORD! 2 O LORD, I HEAR MY VOICE! LET YOUR EARS BE ATTENTIVE TO THE VOICE OF MY PLEAS FOR I MERCY! 3 IF YOU, O LORD, SHOULD MARK IN-1 IQUITIES, O LORD, I WHO COULD STAND? 4 BUT WITH YOU THERE IS FOR-1 GIVENESS, THAT YOU I MAY BE FEARED. 5 1 WAIT FOR THE LORD, MY I SOUL WAITS, AND IN HIS I WORD I HOPE 6 MY SOUL WAITS FOR THE LORD MORE THAN WATCHMEN FOR THE I MORNING, MORE THAN WATCHMEN FOR THE I MORNING. 7 O ISRAEL, HOPE IN THE LORD! FOR WITH THE LORD THERE IS I STEADFAST LOVE, AND WITH HIM IS PLENTIFUL RE-1 DEMPTION. 8 AND HE WILL REDEEM I ISRAEL FROM ALL HIS IN-1 IQUITIES. S|S READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PRAYER GOD, OUR FATHER, WHO IS RICH IN MERCY AND WITH WHOM II PLENTEOUS FORGIVENESS, REMEMBER NOT THE SINS OF OUR YOUTH, NOR OUR TRANSGRESSIONS. BLOT THEM OUT FOR THE SAKE OF JESUS CHRIST, YOUR BELOVED SON, WHO BECAME THE SACRIFICE FOR OUR SINS. FOR THE SAKE OF HIS CRIMSON BLOOD LET OUR SINS BE FOR GOTTEN, AND LET THEM BE IMPUTED TO US NO MORE. AMEN.  7- PSALM 131 R NE 131ST PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION. IT SPEAKS AGAINST THE PROUD, STIFF-NECKED SAINTS WHO COMFORT THEM SELVES BY PLACING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR GREAT SERVICES OF WOR SHIP AND THEIR GREAT HOLINESS, AND NOT IN THE FORGIVENESS OF WHICH THE PRECEDING PSALM SPEAKS. IN CONTRAST TO THE PROUD SAINTS, THE PSALMIST IS DECLARING: I CANNOT TRAVEL SO HIGH AND BOAST OF MY HOLINESS AS THESE PEOPLE DO, WHO RELY ON THEM SELVES. FOR WHENEVER I HAVE WANTED TO DO SO, NOT GROUNDING AND STILLING MY HEART ON GODS GRACE (WHICH IS WHAT IS MEANS TO BE STILL), I BECOME LIKE A WEANED CHILD. WITHOUT THE MILK OF THE PROMISE AND GRACE, I CRY DAY AND NIGHT AND HAVE NO PEACE IN MY CONSCIENCE. THEREFORE, THIS IS THE PSALMISTS CONCLUSION: LET ISRAEL AND EVERYONE TRUST AND HOPE IN GOD AND DEPEND ONLY ON HIS GRACE. LET NO ONE TAKE THIS SUSTENANCE FROM YOU. I COMMEND IT TO YOU, FOR THE PROMISED AND COMING CHRIST IS IN IT. NOTE: LUTHER UNDERSTOOD THE VERSE ABOUT THE WEANED CHILD NOT AS A PICTURE OF A CALM, CONTENDED CHILD (MY SOUL IS QUIET LIKE A CHILD WITH ITS MOTHER), BUT RATHER AS A PICTURE PSALM 131 OF A CHILD DEPRIVED OF ITS MOTHERS BREAST AND THEREFORE DIS TURBED AND UPSET (IF I DO NOT QUIET MY SOUL, I AM LIKE AN UPSET CHILD IN ITS MOTHERS ARMS). THE ONLY SOLUTIONIN EITHER PICTUREIS TO NURSE ON GODS GRACE. |S| 1 O LORD, MY HEART IS NOT LIFTED UP MY EYES ARE NOT I RAISED TOO HIGH I DO NOT OCCUPY MYSELF WITH THINGS TOO GREAT AND TOO MARVEL-1 OUS FOR ME. 2 BUT I HAVE CALMED AND QUIETED MY SOUL, LIKE A WEANED CHILD WITH ITS I MOTHER LIKE A WEANED CHILD IS MY SOUL WITH-1 IN ME. 3 O ISRAEL, HOPE I IN THE LORD FROM THIS TIME FORTH AND FOR-1 EVERMORE. PRAYER LORD JESUS, WHO HUMBLED YOURSELF TO BEAR OUR SINS IN YOUR OWN BODY, AND TO SUFFER THE SHAMEFUL DEATH OF THE CROSS, GRANT US YOUR SPIRIT OF MEEKNESS THAT WE MAY WALK IN TRUE HUMILITY. TAKE FROM US ALL HAUGHTINESS AND PRIDE, THAT WE SEEK NOT GREAT THINGS, AND CREATE IN US THAT MIND BY WHICH WE COUNT YOUR GRACE SUFFICIENT UNTO US. AMEN. J|7 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER R 132ND PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER IN WHICH SOLOMON, OR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL, PRAY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE KINGDOM. THAT IS, THEY PRAY FOR THE SPIRITUAL AND WORLDLY AUTHORITIES: FOR GODS WORD AND TEM PORAL PEACE. FOR WHERE THESE BOTH STAND WELL, THINGS GO WELL. THE PSALMIST GOES ON TO TELL HOW SUCH A PRAYER IS NOT ONLY HEARD, BUT THAT GOD HAS PROMISED WITH AN OATH TO PRE SERVE THE KINGDOM AND PRIESTHOOD IN JERUSALEM AND TO DWELL THERE HIMSELF. HE WILL GIVE ALL BLESSING AND GRACE HIMSELF AND BRING THEIR ENEMIES DOWN TO DISGRACE, SO LONG AS THEY ALSO KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS AND BE OBEDIENT TO HIM. WHY, HOWEVER, HE CALLED THE PLACE OF GODS DWELLING EPHRATHAH AND THE FIELDS OF JAAR IS TOO LONG TO COMMENT ON HERE AND BELONGS IN A COMMENTARY. 1 REMEMBER, O LORD, IN DAVIDS I FAVOR, ALL THE HARDSHIPS I HE ENDURED, 2 HOW HE SWORE I TO THE LORD AND VOWED TO THE MIGHTY ONE OF I JACOB,  I WILL NOT EN-1 TER MY HOUSE OR GEL IN-1 TO MY BED, 4 1 WILL NOT GIVE SLEEP I TO MY EYES OR SLUMBER TO MY I EYELIDS, 5 UNTIL 1 FIND A PLACE I FOR THE LORD, A DWELLING PLACE FOR THE MIGHTY ONE OF I JACOB. 6 BEHOLD, WE HEARD OF IT IN I EPHRATHAH WE FOUND IT IN THE I FIELDS OF JAAR. 7 LET US GO TO HIS I DWELLING PLACE LET US WORSHIP AT HIS I FOOTSTOOL! 3|3 PSAJM 132 8 ANSE, O LORD, AND GO TO YOUR I RESTING PLACE, YOU AND THE ARK I OF YOUR MIGHT. 9 LET YOUR PRIESTS BE CLOTHED WITH I RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND LET YOUR SAINTS I SHOUT FOR JOY. 10 FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SERVANT I DAVID, DO NOT TURN AWAY THE FACE OF YOUR A-1 NOINTED ONE. 11 THE LORD SWORE TO DAVID A SURE OATH FROM WHICH HE WILL I NOT TUM BACK: ONE OF THE SONS OF YOUR BODY I WILL SET I ON YOUR THRONE. 12 IF YOUR SONS KEEP MY COVENANT AND MY TESTIMONIES THAT I SHALL I TEACH THEM, THEIR SONS ALSO FOREVER SHALL SIT I ON YOUR THRONE." 13 FOR THE LORD HAS CHOSEN I ZION HE HAS DESIRED IT FOR HIS I DWELLING PLACE: 14 THIS IS MY RESTING PLACE FOR-1 EVER HERE I WILL DWELL, FOR I HAVE DE-1 SIRED IT. 15 1 WILL ABUNDANTLY BLESS HER PRO-1 VISIONS I WILL SATISFY HER I POOR WITH BREAD. 16 HER PRIESTS I WILL CLOTHE WITH SAL-1 VATION, AND HER SAINTS WILL I SHOUT FOR JOY. 17 THERE I WILL MAKE A HORN TO SPROUT FOR I DAVID I HAVE PREPARED A LAMP FOR MY A-1 NOINTED. 18 HIS ENEMIES I WILL I CLOTHE WITH SHAME, BUT ON HIM HIS I CROWN WILL SHINE " PRAYER YOU, O CHRIST, ARE WORTHY TO RECEIVE HONOR AND PRAISE, BECAUSE YOU GATHER FOR YOURSELF A CHURCH OUT OF EVERY KIN DRED AND TONGUE AND NATION. BECAUSE YOU HAVE CALLED US INTO YOUR KINGDOM, MAKE US YOUR LOYAL SUBJECTS THAT, DRESSED IN YOUR LIVERY AND JUSTIFIED IN THE SIGHT OF THE FATHER THROUGH YOUR REDEMPTION, WE MAY ALSO WALK AS YOUR SUBJECTS, GLORI FYING YOUR NAME UPON EARTH. AMEN. 9|9 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER C--NE 133RD PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION (IN BOTH THE SPIRITUAL AND WORLDLY STATIONS). WE SHOULD LIVE TOGETHER HARMONIOUSLY AS FRIENDS, HAVING ONE TEACHER, ONE AUTHORITY, AND THAT EACH SHOULD CARRY THE BURDEN OF THE OTHER. THE PSALMIST GIVES TWO COMPARISONS: FIRST, OF THE ANOINTING OIL WHICH FLOWS FROM AARONS HEAD OVER HIS BEARD AND ROBES SECOND, OF THE DEW WHICH FALLS FROM ML. HERMON ONTO ML. ZION. WHERE THINGS HAPPEN IN THIS WAY, THERE GOD GLADLY DWELLS WITH ALL HIS GRACE, BLESSING, AND LIFE. BUT WHERE DIS UNITY AND TACTION PREVAIL, THERE THE DEVIL DWELLS, AND DEATH, AND ALL MISFORTUNE. |SS 1 BEHOLD, HOW GOOD AND PLEAS- I ANT IT IS WHEN BROTHERS DWELL IN I UNITY! 2 IT IS LIKE THE PRECIOUS OIL ON THE HEAD, RUNNING DOWN ON THE BEARD, ON THE BEARD OF I AARON, RUNNING DOWN ON THE COLLAR I OF HIS ROBES! 3 IT IS LIKE THE DEW OF HERMON, WHICH FALLS ON THE MOUNTAINS OF I ZION! FOR THERE THE LORD HAS COMMANDED THE BLESSING, LIFE FOR- I EVERMORE. PRAYER LORD JESUS, YOU WHO ARE OUR PEACE WITH THE FATHER, BECAUSE BY YOUR BLOOD YOU HAVE RECONCILED US TO HIM, GRANT AND PRESERVE PEACE IN CHURCH AND STATE, AND TEACH US WHO DWELL UNDER THE SAME ROOF TO BE OF ONE HEART AND ONE MIND. REMOVE FROM US ALL ENVY AND STRIFE, AND LET YOUR PEACE DWELL IN OUR HEARTS THAT WE MAY LIVE AND DIE IN PEACE. AMEN. PSALM 134 R 134IH PSALM IS A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION. IT TEACH ES AND ADMONISHES THE PRIESTS AND SPIRITUAL ONES OF THEIR OFFICE. THEY SHOULD WORSHIP GOD FAITHFULLY AND DILIGENTLY, DAY AND NIGHT PRAISING GOD. PREACHING, AND OCCUPYING THEM SELVES WITH HIS WORD AS ST. PAUL ALSO SAYS TO TIMOTHY (2 TIMOTHY 4:21). THEY SHOULD CONTINUE FAITHFULLY IN THEIR OFFICE. THEY SHOULD NOT CONCERN THEMSELVES THAT PEOPLE DESPISE THE WORD AND TURN FROM IT TO FABLES. FOR WHERE ONE DISCARDS GODS WORD, THERE BOTH SPIRITUAL AND WORLDLY OFFICES WILL FALL AS WELLAT THE LAST, FALL INTO ERROR AND ABAN DONED BY GOD, FALL INTO THE DEVIL'S POWER. HOWEVER, WHERE PREACHING CONTINUES, THERE HE WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH IS ALWAYS PRESENT TO BLESS. FOR THE SAKE OF THE WORD, HE HELPS AND GIVES ALL BLESSINGS EVEN TO THE UNWORTHY AND THE UNTHANKFUL. LET THIS PSALM BE SUNG BY YOU PASTORS, PREACHERS, BISHOPS, AND WHOEVER SITS IN A SPIRI TUAL OFFICE. 1 COME, BLESS THE LORD, ALL YOU SERVANTS I OF THE LORD. WHO STAND BY NIGHT IN THE HOUSE I OF THE LORD' 2 LIFT UP YOUR HANDS TO THE I HOLY PLACE AND I BLESS THE LORD!  MAY THE LORD BLESS YOU FROM I ZION. HE WHO MADE I HEAVEN AND EARTH! READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER PRAYER LORD JESUS, THE ONE TRUE SHEPHERD AND BISHOP OF YOUR CHURCH, AT ALL TIMES GRANT TRUE AND FAITHFUL PASTORS AND TEACH ERS, MEN EAGER TO PERFORM ALL THEIR OFFICE. ENDOW THEM WITH THE NEEDED GIFTS TO PREACH YOUR WORD WITH POWER, AND TO MAKE CONQUEST AFTER CONQUEST, TO THE GLORY OF YOUR NAME AND THE SALVATION OF MANY SOULS. AMEN. C|HE 135TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS. IT CALLS THE PRIESTS TO GIVE THANKS, PREACH, AND PRAISE GOD FOR THE WON DERS THAT HE SHOWED TO THE PEOPLE IN EGYPT AND CANAAN, SO THAT THEY NEVER FORGET GOD AND SEEK IDOLS OR OTHER GODS. THIS HAPPENS WHEN ONE DOES NOT OCCUPY ONESELF WITHAND DILIGENTLY HOLD TOPREACHING AND THE PRAISE OF GOD, AS IT SAYS IN THE NEXT PSALM. BUT WHERE HIS WORD IS SILENCED AND HE DOES NOT JUDGE OR TEACH, THERE TRULY SHALL BE GREAT ANGER AND NO GRACE. THEREFORE THINK, YOU SERVANTS IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD, AND PREACH DILIGENTLY OF GOD AND HIS WORKS. |33 1 PRAISE THE LORD! PRAISE THE NAME I OF THE LORD, GIVE PRAISE, O SERVANTS I OL THE LORD, 2 WHO STAND IN THE HOUSE I OF THE LORD, IN THE COURTS OF THE HOUSE I OF OUR GOD! 3 PRAISE THE LORD, FOR THE I LORD IS GOOD SING TO HIS NAME, FOR IT IS I PLEASANT! 4 FOR THE LORD HAS CHOSEN JACOB I FOR HIMSELF, ISRAEL AS HIS OWN POS-1 SESSION. 322 PSALM 135 S FOR 1 KNOW THAT THE I LORD IS GREAT, AND THAT OUR LORD IS A- ! BOVE ALL GODS. 6 WHATEVER THE LORD PLEASES, HE DOES, IN HEAVEN I AND ON EARTH| IN THE SEAS AND I ALL DEEPS. 7 HE IT IS WHO MAKES THE CLOUDS RISE AT THE END I OF THE EARTH. WHO MAKES LIGHTNINGS FOR THE RAIN AND BRINGS FORTH THE WIND FROM HIS I STOREHOUSES. 8 HE IT WAS WHO STRUCK DOWN THE FIRSTBORN OF I EGYPT. BOTH OF MAN ! AND OF BEAST 9 WHO IN YOUR MIDST, O I EGYPT, SENT SIGNS AND WONDERS AGAINST PHARAOH AND ALL HIS I SERVANTS 10 WHO STRUCK DOWN MANY I NATIONS AND KILLED I MIGHTY KINGS, 11 SIHON, KING OF THE AMORITES. AND OG, KING OF I BASHAN, AND ALL THE KINGDOMS OF I CANAAN, AND GAVE THEIR LAND AS A I HERITAGE, A HERITAGE TO HIS PEOPLE I ISRAEL. N YOUR NAME, O LORD, ENDURES FOR- 1 EVER. YOUR RENOWN, O LORD, THROUGHOUT ALL I AGES. U FOR THE LORD WILL VINDICATE HIS I PEOPLE AND HAVE COMPASSION ON HIS I SERVANTS. IS THE IDOLS OF THE NATIONS ARE SIL-1 VER AND GOLD. THE WORK OF I HUMAN HANDS. 16 THEY HAVE MOUTHS, BUT I DO NOT SPEAK THEY HAVE EYES, BUT I DO NOT SEE ,7 THEY HAVE EARS, BUT I DO NOT HEAR, NOR IS THERE ANY BREATH I IN THEIR MOUTHS. THOSE WHO MAKE THEM BE-1 COME LIKE THEM. SO DO ALL WHO I MIST IN THEM! 323 READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 19 O HOUSE OF ISRAEL, I BLESS THE LORD! 5  1 O HOUSE OF AARON, I BLESS THE LORD! 20 O HOUSE OF LEVI, I BLESS THE LORD! YOU WHO FEAR THE LORD, I BLESS THE LORD! 21 BLESSED BE THE LORD FROM I ZION, HE WHO DWELLS IN JERUSALEM! I PRAISE THE LORD! HRAYER O LORD, LET THIS YOUR LITTLE FLOCK, YOUR NAME ALONE CONFESSING, CONTINUE IN YOUR LOVING CARE. TRUE UNITY POSESSING. YOUR SACRAMENTS, O LORD, AND YOUR SAVING WORD TO US. LORD, PURE RETAIN.

O MAKE US FAITHFUL CHRISTIANS, OSB 647: 2 .3) PSALM 136 C|HE 136TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS AND IS PERHAPS THE TEXT TO SHOW PNESTS HOW THEY SHOULD SING AND PREACH. NAMELY, THEY SHOULD SING AND PREACH OF GOD AND HIS WON DERFUL DEEDS, THAT HE IS GRACIOUS AND MERCIFUL AND A TRUE SAVIOR. THEREFORE, IN EACH VERSE THE PSALMIST REPEATS THE LINE, HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER" WITH WHICH THE PSALM IS NEARLY OVERWHELMED. TRULY NOTHING BUT GRACE, NOT HUMAN WORKS OR DOCTRINES, SHOULD EVER BE PREACHED. FOR HUMAN WORKS AND WORDS HAVE DONE NO WONDERS SUCH AS THESE. THEY ARE NOT DESERVING OF THIS WORSHIP, BUT RATHER ONLY THE GRACE AND PURE GOODNESS OF HIM WHO GIVES ALL. GIFT! GIFT, HE SAYS! GIFTFREE OF CHARGE! AND CHRIST ALSO STANDS HIDDEN IN THE PHRASE. SUCH DOCTRINE KEEPS IN THE PEOPLE A PURE FAITH AND A RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF GRACE AND THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS, AGAINST THE REBELLIOUS AND STIFF-NECKED WORK-SAINTS. 1 GIVE THANKS TO THE LORD, FOR I HE IS GOOD.

PSALM 137 CJFE 137TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER IN THE PERSON OF CAPTIVES IN BABYLON. IT IS A PRAYER TOR JERUSALEM, THAI IS, FOR GODS WORD AND SPIRITUAL RULE THAT LAY COMPLETELY DESTROYED FOR THUS IT WAS ASSUMED (WITH GREAT REASON) ESPECIALLY BY THOSE WHO FEAR GOD, AS THIS PSALM SHOWS. ALTHOUGH BABYLON AND EDOM GREATLY REJOICED AT THIS DESTRUCTION AND MOCKED THOSE WHO LAMENTED IT. YET THEY SHOULD NOT THEREBY ESCAPE, UNREPENTANT AND BLAMELESS, BUT RATHER SHALL BE TOM TO PIECES IN RETURN. THEIR CHILDREN ALSO SHALL BE DASHED ON THE ROCKS, AND THEY SHALL HAVE NO DESCEN DANTS. THIS INDEED HAPPENED TO BABYLON AND SHALL ALSO HAP PEN TO OUR EDOMITES AND BABYLONIANS OF TODAY, WHO REJOICE, MOCKING BOTH THE POOR CHURCH, TOM TO PIECES, AND THE DESTRUCTION OF GODS WORD AND WORSHIP BUT FOR ALL THAT. ISRAEL AND GODS WORD SHALL REMAIN FOREVER AND EVER.

AMEN. PSALM 138 PSALM UU NE 138TH PSALM IS A GENERAL PSALM OF THANKS FOR A VARIETY OF DELIVERANCES FROM THE ENEMIES. THE PSALMIST WISHES THAT CHRIST'S KINGDOM WOULD COME AND KINGS WOULD RECEIVE HIS WORD AND DOCTRINE, GIVE THANKS FOR IT. AND WOR SHIP HIM ARIGHT. THEY MUST LEARN THAT CHRIST'S KINGDOM EXISTS, THAT IT SITS ON HIGH, AND THAT HE HELPS THE LOWLY WHO ARE STUCK IN WOE AND FEAR, AND COMFORTS AND RESCUES SINNERS AND THE MISERABLE. THE PSALM CLOSES WITH THE PRAYER THAT GOD WOULD NOT ABANDON HIS KINGDOM AND WORK THUS BEGUN, BUT BRING THEM TO FULFILLMENT IN ETERNITY. 1 I GIVE YOU THANKS, O LORD, WITH I MY WHOLE HEART 4 BEFORE THE GODS 11 SING YOUR PRAISE 2 1 BOW DOWN TOWARD YOUR HOLY TEMPLE AND GIVE THANKS TO YOUR NAME FOR YOUR STEADFAST LOVE AND YOUR I FAITHFULNESS, FOR YOU HAVE EXALTED ABOVE ALL THINGS YOUR NAME I AND YOUR WORD.

FOR GREAT IS THE GLORY I OF THE LORD. 6 FOR THOUGH THE LORD IS HIGH, HE REGARDS THE I LOWLY, BUT THE HAUGHTY HE KNOWS I FROM AFAR 7 THOUGH 1 WALK IN THE MIDST OF TROUBLE, YOU PRE-1 SERVE MY LIFE READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER YOU STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND AGAINST THE WRATH OF MY ENEMIES, AND YOUR NGHT HAND DE-1 LIVERS ME. 8 THE LORD WILL FULFILL HIS PUR- I POSE FOR ME YOUR STEADFAST LOVE, O LORD, ENDURES FOREVER. DO NOT FORSAKE THE WORK I OF YOUR HANDS. PRAYER RENEWED THANKS DO WE RETURN UNTO YOU, O FATHER OF MERCY, FOR ALL YOUR LOVING-KINDNESS TOWARD US AND CHIEFLY, BECAUSE YOU HAVE CALLED US INTO THE KINGDOM OF YOUR SON, OUR SAVIOR. CLEANSE US FROM SIN BY HIS BLOOD, AND REMEMBER NOT OUR TRANSGRESSIONS AGAINST US. DO NOT FORSAKE THE WORK OF YOUR OWN HANDS THAT, DELIVERED FROM OUR ENEMIES, WE MAY EVERMORE PRAISE YOU. AMEN. PSALM 139 R 139TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS THAT PRAIS ES GOD THAT HE HAS PROVIDED FOR THEM SO WONDERFULLY AND STILL REIGNS IN ALL OF HIS WORKS, WORDS, AND THOUGHTS. WHETHER THE PSALMIST STANDS, WALKS, SLEEPS, OR WAKES YES, EVEN IN HIS MOTHERS WOMB, BEFORE HE WAS MADE GOD HAS BEEN WITH HIM AS HE WAS BEING FORMED AND WILL BE WITH HIM AS LONG AS HE LIVES. IT IS AS IF THE PSALMIST SHOULD SAY: EVERY HUMAN ABIL ITY OR POWERHOW WE LIVE, WHAT WE DO, SPEAK, THINK, WHEREVER AND WHENEVER, FROM WHERE WE COME AND TO WHERE WE SHOULD GOIT IS ALL CLEARLY GODS WORK AND ART. WHAT THEN DO THE ABOMINABLE UNGODLY DO, THOSE WHO DO NOT BELIEVE THIS BUT WANT TO MAKE THEMSELVES PIOUS 3J0 PSALM 139 THROUGH THEIR VEXATIOUS WORK? THEY WANT TO HAVE DONE WHAT THEY DO AND THEN WANT TO RECEIVE WORSHIP, HONOR, AND GLORY FROM GOD ON ACCOUNT OF IT. BUT THEY DO NOT CREATE SO MUCH AS ONE WORD BY THEMSELVES, INDEED CANNOT CREATE ONE THOUGHT BY THEIR OWN POWER MOREOVER, THEY DO NOT UNDER STAND WHAT THEY DO. HOW THEY ARE CREATED, HOW THEY LIVE, SPEAK, AND THINK BECAUSE ALL THAT WE ARE AND DO ARE GOD'S WORK AND POWERS, HOW CAN THEY CONSIDER IT TO BE THEIR OWN NOBLE WORK TO MAKE THEMSELVES GODLY, PRAISE THEIR FREE WILL, AND DELIVER THEMSELVES FROM SIN AND DEATH? SUCH PEOPLE CANNOT NGHTLY SPEAK ABOUT GOD AND HIS WORI. PROTECT US FROM THIS, O GOD, AND BLESS MY HEART, SO THAT 1 MAY REMAIN IN THE TRUE WAY THAT STANDS FOREVER. 1 O LORD, YOU HAVE SEARCHED ME AND I KNOWN ME! 2 YOU KNOW' WHEN I SIT DOWN AND WHEN I RISE UP: YOU DISCERN MY THOUGHTS I FROM ALAR. 1 YOU SEARCH OUT MY PATH AND MY I LYING DOWN AND ARE ACQUAINTED WITH I ALL MY WAYS. 4 EVEN BEFORE A WORD IS I ON MY TONGUE. BEHOLD. O LORD, YOU KNOW IT ALTO- I GETHER. 5 YOU HEM ME IN, BEHIND I AND BEFORE, AND LAY YOUR HAND UP- I ON ME 6 SUCH KNOWLEDGE IS TOO WONDER-1 FUL FOR ME IT IS HIGH 1 CANNOT I ATTAIN IT. 7 WHERE SHALL I GO FROM YOUR I SPIRIT? OR WHERE SHALL 1 FLEE FROM YOUR I PRESENCE 8 IF 1 ASCEND TO HEAVEN. I YOU ARE THERE! IF I MAKE MY BED IN SHEOL. I YOU ARE THERE' 9 IF I TAKE THE WINGS OF THE I MORNING AND DWELL IN THE UTTERMOST PARTS I OF THE SEA. TO EVEN THERE YOUR HAND SHALL I LEAD ME. AND YOUR RIGHT HAND SHALL I HOLD ME R9R9| READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 11 IF 1 SAY, SURELY THE DARKNESS SHALL I COVER ME, AND THE LIGHT ABOUT ME I BE NIGHT, 12 EVEN THE DARKNESS IS NOT I DARK TO YOU THE NIGHT IS BRIGHT AS THE DAY, FOR DARKNESS IS AS I LIGHT WITH YOU. 13 FOR YOU FORMED MY I INWARD PARTS YOU KNITTED ME TOGETHER IN MY I MOTHERS WOMB. PRAYER TO YOU, O GOD, BELONG PRAISE AND GLORY FOR YOUR WON DERFUL PROVIDENCE, THAT YOU ARE PRESENT WITH ALL YOUR CREA TURES, AND PRESERVE THEM IN THEIR BEING. TEACH US TO REMEM BER AT ALL TIMES AND ALL PLACES THAT YOUR EYES ARE UPON US, AND THAT ALL OUR DEEDS ARE RECORDED IN YOUR BOOK. BLOT OUT THE SINS THAT ARE PAST WITH THE BLOOD OF CHRIST, AND CAUSE US TO WALK IN YOUR FEAR, AND TO AVOID SIN. AMEN. 14 1 PRAISE YOU, FOR I AM FEARFULLY AND WONDER- I FULLY MADE. WONDERFUL ARE YOUR WORKS MY SOUL KNOWS IT I VERY WELL. 15 MY FRAME WAS NOT HID-1 DEN FROM YOU, WHEN I WAS BEING MADE IN SECRET, INTRICATELY WOVEN IN THE DEPTHS I OF THE EARTH. ,6 YOUR EYES SAW MY UNFORMED SUBSTANCE IN YOUR BOOK WERE WRITTEN, EVERY I ONE OF THEM, THE DAYS THAT WERE FORMED FOR ME, WHEN AS YET THERE WERE I NONE OF THEM. 17 HOW PRECIOUS TO ME ARE YOUR THOUGHTS. I O GOD! HOW VAST IS THE I SUM OF THEM! 18 IF I WOULD COUNT THEM, THEY ARE MORE I THAN THE SAND. I AWAKE, AND I AM STILL I WITH YOU.  9 OH THAT YOU WOULD SLAY THE WICKED, I O GOD! O MEN OF BLOOD, DE-1 PART FROM ME! PSALM 140 20 THEY SPEAK AGAINST YOU WITH MAIL-1 CIOUS INTENT YOUR ENEMIES TAKE YOUR I NAME IN VAIN! 21 DO I NOT HATE THOSE WHO HATE YOU, I O LORD?

TRY ME AND I KNOW MY THOUGHTS! 24 AND SEE IF THERE BE ANY GNEVOUS I WAY IN ME, AND LEAD ME IN THE WAY EVER-1 LASTING! PRAYER HOW EXCELLENT, O LORD, HAVE YOUR THOUGHTS BEEN TOWARD US, IN THAT YOU MADE US AFTER YOUR IMAGE. AND WHEN WE WERE LOST IN SIN. YOU SENT YOUR SON TO REDEEM US, AND GRANTED YOUR SPIRIT TO RENEW US UNTO RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TRUE HOLINESS. THANKS BE TO YOUR MERCY, NOW AND FOREVER. AMEN. PSALM 140 TE 140TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER AGAINST THE PROUD, WICKED SAINTS WHO PLACE MANY TRAPS AND ANNOYANCES IN THE RIGHT WAY, AGAINST GODS WORD. THEY THREATEN AND RAGE AGAINST ALL THOSE WHO DO NOT PRAISE AND FOLLOW THEIR ERRORS. THE PSALM PRAYS THAT THEIR PLANS MAY NOT SUCCEED BUT RATHER MAY FALL ON THEIR OWN HEAD AND THAT IT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM AS TO PHARAOH IN THE RED SEA, THAT THE STORM MAY HURL THEM INTO THE SEA AND THEY MAY BE DROWNED. THUS MAY SUCH EVIL MOUTHS BE SILENCED AND THE BELIEVERS REMAIN BEFORE GOD FOREVER. MS READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER 1 DELIVER ME, O LORD, FROM I EVIL MEN PRESERVE ME FROM I VIOLENT MEN, 2 WHO PLAN EVIL THINGS I IN THEIR HEART AND STIR UP WARS CON-1 TINUALLY. 3 THEY MAKE THEIR TONGUE SHARP AS A I SERPENTS, AND UNDER THEIR LIPS IS THE VEN-1 OM OF ASPS. 4 GUARD ME, O LORD, FROM THE HANDS OF THE WICKED PRESERVE ME FROM I VIOLENT MEN, WHO HAVE PLANNED TO TRIP I UP MY FEET. 5 THE ARROGANT HAVE HIDDEN A TRAP FOR ME, AND WITH CORDS THEY HAVE I SPREAD A NET BESIDE THE WAY THEY HAVE SET I SNARES FOR ME. 6 I SAY TO THE LORD, YOU I ARE MY GOD GIVE EAR TO THE VOICE OF MY PLEAS FOR MERCY, I O LORD! 7 O LORD, MY LORD, THE STRENGTH OF MY SAL-1 VATION, YOU HAVE COVERED MY HEAD IN THE DAY OF I BATTLE. 8 GRANT NOT, O LORD, THE DESIRES OF THE I WICKED DO NOT FURTHER THEIR EVIL PLOT OR THEY WILL BE EX-1 ALTED! 9 AS FOR THE HEAD OF THOSE WHO SUR-1 ROUND ME, LET THE MISCHIEF OF THEIR LIPS OVER-1 WHELM THEM! 10 LET BURNING COALS FALL UP-1 ON THEM!

RSUINI I HI PRAYER O LORD, GOD OF STRENGTH, BRING TO NAUGHT THE COUNSELS OF YOUR ENEMIES, AND FRUSTRATE THEIR WICKED DESIGNS. TUM THE HEARTS OF OUR ENEMIES THAT THEY MAY CEASE THEIR HATRED AGAINST US, AND CREATE IN US PEACEABLE HEARTS THAT DO NOT CHER ISH HATE AND DO NOT SEEK REVENGE, BUT CRAVE PEACE WITH ALL MEN AND STRIVE TO FOLLOW THOSE THINGS WHICH MAKE FOR PEACE, THROUGH JESUS CHRIST, OUR LORD. AMEN. PSALM 141 R 141ST PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER. THE PSALMIST PRAYS THAT HE MAY BE PRESERVED FROM THE UNGODLY TEACHERS, WHO APPEAR TO BE FRIENDLY AND SPEAK WITH SMOOTH WORDS WHEN THREATS DO NOT WORK. IT IS BETTER FOR ME (HE SAYS) THAT RIGHTEOUS TEACHERS REBUKE ME AND CONDEMN MY RIGHTEOUS NESS, THAN THAT THE GODLESS PRAISE ME. AND IF, IN THE MEANTIME, EVIL COMES UPON ME AND I SUF FER CROSS AND DEATH AND 1 AM UPROOTED AND TOM APART, STILL IT IS BETTER FOR ME TO TRUST IN THE LORD. THEIR HYPOCRISY WILL FINALLY BREAK THEIR NECK ON A ROCK, THAT IS, BE SUDDENLY OVER THROWN AND COME TO AN EVIL END. THEN THEY WILL SEE HOW BITTER IS THEIR SWEET TEACHING AND HOW PRECIOUS IS MY SOUR DOCTRINE. THEIR OWN DOCTRINE, IN WHICH THEY ARE CAUGHT AS IN A NET, WILL BRING THEM DOWN, WHILE 1 PASS BY IN SAFETY.

GOD OT ISRAEL, TN YOUR TEMPLE OF OLD YOUR PEOPLE ACCORDING LO YOUR LAW BROUGHT THE OFFERING OL A LAMB MORN INGS AND EVENINGS, AND THIS WAS WELL PLEASING TO YOU WHEN IT WAS OFFERED AS A FIGURE OF THAT LAMB WHICH SHOULD COME TO SAVE ISRAEL FROM SIN FOR THE SAKE OF THIS LAMB, EVEN JESUS CHRIST, LET OUR SACRIFICE BE ACCEPTABLE IN YOUR SIGHT, WHEN NIGHT AND MORNING WE CRY FOR THE REMISSION OF ALL OUR SINS AMEN. C|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

LSA 3 333 PSALM 143 PSALM 143 LE 143RD PSALM IS A PSALM OF PRAYER THE PSALMISI PRAYS LOR GRACE AND FORGIVENESS OF SINS, IN THE TERROR OF HIS CONSCIENCE. HE IS NEARLY PRESSED TO DESPAIR BY THE ENEMIES OL FAITH, THAT IS. THE PROMOTERS OF THE LAVE THESE ESPECIALLY PLAGUE THE DISTRESSED AND TIMID CONSCIENCE AND DRIVE IT INTO DARKNESS, THAT IS. INTO DESPAIR AND DEATH WITH HEAVY BURDENS AND UNBEARABLE DOCTRINE OF WORKS, WHICH THEY DO NOT SO MUCH AS TOUCH WITH ONE OF THEIR LINGERS, AS CHRIST SAYS (MATTHEW 23:1). BUT HERE THE PSALM SHOWS THAT GRACE PROVIDES DELIVER ANCE, NOT THE JUDGMENT BEFORE WHICH NO ONE ALIVE CAN STAND OF THIS ALL THE ANCIENT HISTONES AND WORKS OF THE LORD ALSO GIVE W ITNESS. FOR ALL OF THE HOLY PATRIARCHS OF OLD PLACED THEIR HOPE ON GOD'S LOVE AND GRACE, NOT ON THE JUDGMENT AS ST PETER ALSO SAYS (ACTS 15:10). NOW THEN, WHY DO YOU TRY TO TEST GOD BY PUTTING ON THE NECKS OF THE DISCIPLES A YOKE THAT NEITHER WE NOR OUR FATHERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BEAR? NO! WE BELIEVE IT IS THROUGH THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS THAT WE ARE SAVED, JUST AS THEY ARE." I CONSIDER THEIR WORKS AND EXAMPLES OF OLD (HE SAYS HERE), AND 1 AM COMFORTED, FOR THEY WERE COMFORTED AND DELIVERED FROM SIN PURELY FROM GRACE, JUST AS I AM. EVEN ABRAHAM HIMSELF WAS CALLED FROM OUT OF IDOLATRY (JOSHUA 24:2). NO PRAISE OF HUMAN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR HOLINESS HAS AN VALUE HERE AT ALL. NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE FALSE PROPHETS WORRY US. READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER |43 1 HEAR MY PRAYER, O LORD GIVE EAR TO MY PLEAS FOR I MERCY! IN YOUR FAITHFULNESS ANSWER ME, IN YOUR I RIGHTEOUSNESS! 2 ENTER NOT INTO JUDGMENT WITH YOUR I SERVANT FOR NO ONE LIVING IS RIGHTEOUS BE-1 FORE YOU. 3 FOR THE ENEMY HAS PURSUED MY SOUL HE HAS CRUSHED MY LIFE I TO THE GROUND HE HAS MADE ME SIT IN DARKNESS LIKE I THOSE LONG DEAD. 4 THEREFORE MY SPIRIT FAINTS WITH-1 IN ME MY HEART WITHIN ME I IS APPALLED. 5 1 REMEMBER THE DAYS OF OLD I MEDITATE ON ALL THAT I YOU HAVE DONE I PONDER THE WORK I OF YOUR HANDS. 6 1 STRETCH OUT MY I HANDS TO YOU MY SOUL THIRSTS FOR YOU LIKE A I PARCHED LAND. 7 ANSWER ME QUICKLY, O LORD! MY I SPIRIT FAILS! HIDE NOT YOUR FACE FROM ME, LEST I BE LIKE THOSE WHO GO DOWN I TO THE PIT. 8 LET ME HEAR IN THE MORNING OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE, FOR IN I YOU I TRUST. MAKE ME KNOW THE WAY I SHOULD GO, FOR TO YOU I LIFT I UP MY SOUL. 9 DELIVER ME FROM MY ENEMIES, I O LORD! I HAVE FLED TO YOU FOR I REFUGE! 10 TEACH ME TO DO YOUR WILL, FOR YOU I ARE MY GOD! LET YOUR GOOD SPIRIT LEAD ME ON I LEVEL GROUND! 11 FOR YOUR NAMES SAKE, O LORD, PRE-1 SERVE MY LIFE! IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS BRING MY SOUL OUT OF I TROUBLE! 346 ? AND IN YOUR STEADFAST LOVE YOU WILL CUT OFT MY I ENEMIES. 1 AND YOU WILL DESTROY ALL THE ADVERSARIES OF MY SOUL, FOR 1 AM YOUR I SERVANT. PRAYER BY YOUR GRACE, O GOD. GRANT US THE FORGIVENESS OF ALL OUR SINS. AND BY YOUR HOLY SPIRIT ENLIGHTEN OUR EYES TO SEE BOTH OUR OWN SINFULNESS AND THE HOLINESS OF YOUR LAW. THAT OUR TRUST MAY NOT STAND IN THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF WORKS, BUT IN YOUR GRACE WHICH YOU HAVE PROMISED IN YOUR SON. JESUS CHRIST, WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR US TO SANCTIFY AND CLEANSE US. AMEN PSALM 144 C 144TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS FOR KINGS AND THOSE IN AUTHORITY. DAVID, A KING WHO HAS TO WAGE WAR AND RULE, GIVES THANKS TO GOD WITH THIS PSALM. HE CONFESSES THAT VICTORY, GOOD FORTUNE, AND SUCCESSWHETHER IN CONFLICT OR IN GOVERNMENTARE GIFTS OF GOD AND DO NOT COME FROM HUMAN POWER AND ABILITY. LITTLE DOES HUMAN WISDOM KNOW HOW TO KEEP SUBJECTS UNDER AUTHORITY AND TO RULE LAND AND PEOPLE WELL. FOR HOW SHOULD HE BE CAPABLE OF THESE GREAT THINGS WHEN HE IS NOTHING AND PASSES AWAY LIKE A SHADOW ? INSTEAD, THE LORD DOES THIS. HE SENDS FOR THE LIGHTNING SENDING DISCOURAGED AND FRIGHTENED HEARTS TO THE ARMY AND HUMBLE HEARTS AMONG THE PEOPLE. WHERE HE THUS TOUCHES THE MOUNTAINS AND THE MULTITUDES, SO THAT THEY ARE IN FEAR BEFORE HIM, THERE IT IS GOOD TO FIGHT AND RULE, FOR THERE VIC TORY AND GOOD FORTUNE FOLLOWAS WELL AS THIS TEAR. YET HOW' CAN ONE, BEING ONLY FLESH AND BLOOD, BRING ABOUT THIS FEAR ? J4T| READING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER THEN HE PRAYS AGAINST HIS OWN PEOPLE AND REBUKES THEIR FOOLISHNESS. FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL, HAVING THE RENOWN OF BEING THE PEOPLE OL GOD, WERE NEVERTHELESS PROUD, STIFF, NECKED, DISOBEDIENT, REBELLIOUS, COVETOUS, JEALOUS, AND FAITHLESS, AS INDEED THEY SHOWED BY THEIR OPPOSITION TO MOSES, DAVID, AND OTHER KINGS. AND THOUGH THEY SAW THAT DAVID TOUGHT AND RULED WITH MIRACULOUS WONDERS, AS DID MOSES, YET THEY WERE NO BETTER AND DID NOT INQUIRE ABOUT GOD OR FAITH IN GOD. WHAT GOD? WHAT FAITH? AS LONG AS WE HAVE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN, HOUSES, CATTLE, MANY POSSESSIONS, AND ENJOYABLE DAYS, WE ARE A BLESSED PEOPLE. AND, IN ADDITION, WE HAVE PROPHETS ENOUGH, WHO TEACH US THAT GODS PEOPLE ARE THOSE LOR WHOM THINGS GO WELL. THOSE FOR WHOM THINGS GO BADLY ARE NOT OF GOD." HOWEVER, THINGS DO GO BADLY FOR ALL THE SAINTSFOR THE REASON THAT THEY TRUST IN GOD. YOU HAVE NOW RESCUED ME, DAVID SAYS, FROM THE MUR DEROUS SWORD OF GOLIATH. YOU HAVE GIVEN ME VICTORY OVER OTHER KINGS. THEREFORE, PRESERVE ME ALSO FROM THIS UNGODLY, EVIL, FALSE PEOPLE, WHO LISTEN TO NEITHER GOD NOR MAN. THEY ARE PEASANTS AND BRUTES, YES, TRULY SWINE, WHO ARE CON CERNED FOR NOTHING BUT THEIR OWN BELLY. IT IS HARDER AND MORE DANGEROUS TO RULE OVER THEM THAN TO CONTINUALLY BE AT WAR. HE CALLS THEM FOREIGN CHILDREN, FOR THEY WANT TO BE THE FOREMOST CHILDREN OF GOD, YET THEY ARE FOREIGNERS, STRANGERS, AND WORSE THAN HEATHEN. THEY PRAISE GOD WITH THEIR MOUTHS, WHILE THEIR HEART IS FAR FROM HIM. 1 BLESSED BE THE I LORD, MY ROCK, WHO TRAINS MY HANDS FOR WAR, AND MY FINGERS FOR I BATTLE 2 HE IS MY STEADFAST LOVE AND MY FORTRESS, MY STRONGHOLD AND MY DE-1 LIVERER, 342 PSALM 144 MY SHIELD AND HE IN WHOM 1 LAKE REFUGE, WHO SUBDUES PEOPLES I UNDER ME J O LORD, WHAI IS MAN THAI YOU RE-1 GARD HIM.'

AMEN. PSALM 145 LE 145TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS FOR THE KING DOM OF CHRIST, WHICH WAS TO COME. IT STRONGLY URGES THE HIGH, EXALTED WORK OF PRAISING GOD AND GLORIFYING HIS POWER AND KINGDOM. FOR CHRIST'S KINGDOM AND POWER ARE HIDDEN UNDER THE CROSS. IF THE CROSS WERE NOT EXTOLLED THROUGH PREACHING, TEACHING, AND CONFESSION, WHO COULD HAVE EVER THOUGHT OF IT, TO SAY NOTHING OF KNOWING IT? BUT SUCH IS HIS KINGDOM AND POWER, THAT HE AIDED THE FALLEN, CALLED THE NEEDY TO HIMSELF, MADE SINNERS GODLY, AND BROUGHT THE DEAD TO LIFE. YES, HE IS THE ONE WHO GIVES FOOD TO ALL, WHO HEARS THE CALL OF HIS SAINTS, DOES WHAT THEY DESIRE, AND PROTECTS THEM. 344 1 I WILL EXTOL YOU, MY I GOD AND KING, AND BLESS YOUR NAME FOREVER AND I EVER. 2 EVERY DAY I WILL I BLESS YOU AND PRAISE YOUR NAME FOREVER AND I EVER.

HUMAN HELP IS SO UNCERTAIN AND DOES NOT LAST. FOR WE OUR SELVES DO NOT KNOW THE LENGTH OF OUR LIFE. |46 1 PRAISE I THE LORD! PRAISE THE LORD, I O MY SOUL!

ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIS GOOD NESS AND NOT IN HUMAN STRENGTH OR HORSES? BUT ABOVE ALL. TO JERUSALEM, SPHERE HIS WORD AND HIS DWELLING ARE. HE GIVES PEACE, GRAIN, AND ALL THEY NEED. FOR JERUSALEM AND ISRAEL HAVE THE ADVANTAGE THAT THEY HAVE GODS WORD AND WORSHIP BEFORE ALL THE NATIONS, THEREFORE. HE HAS DONE MORE MIRACLES FROM THEM. HE WILL ALSO BE MUCH MORE RECOGNIZED THERE IN THE DAILY WONDERS SUCH AS RAIN, SNOW, ICE, THAN BY THE FAITH LESS WHO DO NOT HAVE GODS WORD OR DO NOT HEED IT. THESE PEOPLE CANNOT SEE ANY WORK OR WONDER OF GOD. THOUGH THEY ENJOY THEM DAILY WITH THEIR FIVE SENSES, ROOT IN THEM, AND DEVOUR THEM LIKE SWINE THEY DID NOT KNOW GOD BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HEAR OR PAY ATTENTION TO HIS WORD ' PRAISE THE LORD!

HAVE HIS WORD AND WORSHIP. AND NOTE THAT THIS PSALM CONFIRMS ALL THE STATIONS OF LIFEKINGS, JUDGES, OLD. YOUNG. ALL ARE CREATED BY GOD AND ARE GOOD AND HONORABLE FOR IF THE OFFICE OF KING OR OF JUDGE WERE EVIL AND NOT GOD- GIVEN, ONE COULD NOT IN SUCH AN OFFICE PRAISE GOD. BUT WHERE THERE ARE KINGS AND JUDGES, THERE WILL ALSO BE SUBJECTS, SER VANTS, HANGMEN, SOLDIERS, LABORERS, FARMERS, TOWNSPEOPLE WHERE THERE ARE YOUNG AND OLD, THERE WILL BE MARRIED PEOPLE, CHILDREN, AND HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS. ALL ARE HONORABLE AND GOOD AND SHOW THAT THEIR CREATOR IS GOOD. RIGHTFULLY, ALL OF CREATION SHOULD BE NOTHING BUT A TONGUE, ALWAYS PRAISING THIS GREAT GOODNESS OF GOD. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW GOOD A THING IS. THEN TAKE WHATEVER YOU WILL AND SAY: IF THERE WERE NO FIRE ..  OR IF THERE WERE NO SUN . . IF THERE WERE NO HANGMAN . . IF THERE WERE NO WOMAN . . AND SO ON. THEN YOU WILL SEE WHY ONE SHOULD THANK GOD.  PRAISE THE LORD! PRAISE THE LORD FROM THE I HEAVENS 1  PRAISE HIM I IN THE HEIGHTS! 2 PRAISE HIM. ALL HIS I ANGELS PRAISE HIM.

AND THAT THEY NGHTLY SHOULD REJOICE. THEY HAVE THIS BLESSING OR GRACE WHICH IS NGHTLY CALLED THE FORGIVENESS OF SINSTHAT GOD WILL NOT AVENGE HOW' EVIL AND SINFUL THEY ARE. THEREFORE, THIS PSALM IN REALITY BELONGS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. IT CALLS ITSEL! A NEW SONG TO SING TO THE KING OF ZION, WHOM THEY SHOULD PRAISE ON THEIR COUCHES, THAT IS, IN THE CHURCH WHERE THEY COME TOGETHER. (SIMILARLY, ISAIAH CALLED THE CHURCHES AND ALTARS, IN WHICH ISRAEL COMMITTED FORNICATIONTHAT IS, IDOLATRY  COUCHES OR BEDS.) 3J3 KEADING THE PSALMS WITH LUTHER AGAIN, IT BELONGS TO THE NEW TESTAMENT TO HAVE A SHARP SWORD IN HAND TO PUNISH THE HEATHEN, TO THROW KINGS IN STOCK AND DUNGEONS, AND TO TAKE VENGEANCE, AS IT IS WRITTEN. THIS IS THE VENGEANCE THAT IS SPOKEN OF IN THE SCRIPTURES, THAT ABRAHAMS SEED SHOULD STRIKE DOWN IDOLATRY IN ALL THE WORLD THROUGH THE GOSPEL, THE SPIRITUAL SWORD, TAKING PRISONER ALL THE HOLINESS OF THE KINGS AND THE WISE AND SUBJECT THEM TO CHRIST, AS PAUL SAYS IN 2 CORINTHIANS 10:5. |49 1 PRAISE THE LORD!

THIS IS HONOR FOR ALL HIS GODLY ONES. I PRAISE THE LORD! PR A YLR PRAISE, HONOR, AND THANKSGIVING TO YOU, O CHNSI, KING OF GLORY, BECAUSE BY SUFFERING AND DEATH AND THE SHEDDING OF YOUR BLOOD YOU REDEEMED US FROM THE KINGDOM OF DARKNESS, AND MADE US PARTAKERS OF YOUR VICTORY OVER SATAN, SIN, AND DEATH. GRANT US A CHEERFUL FAITH TO SING OF YOUR GRACE WITH HEART AND SOUL AND TO MAKE KNOWN YOUR SALVATION AMONG MEN AMEN ,JL  PSALM 150 C|HE 150TH PSALM IS A PSALM OF THANKS WRITTEN FIRST OF ALL FOR THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL TO PRAISE GOD FOR THEM HIS SANCTUARYTHE FIRMAMENT OF HIS MIGHT, THAT IS. HIS DWELLING PLACE, HEAVEN, AND CASTLEWAS IN JERUSALEM. HERE ALSO HE SHOWED HIS MIGHT WITH MIRACLES AND RECEIVED THE STRING MUSIC AND THE SONGS OF THE JEWS, WITH WHICH THEIR PRAISE AND WORSHIP WAS ACCOMPANIED. BUT FOR THE CHRISTIAN, PREACHING AND THE GOSPEL ARE OUR SIRING MUSIC AND WORSHIP. NOTE THAT ALL PSALMS OF THANKS ARE NOTHING BUT PROMISES FOR THE POOR, TROUBLED CONSCIENCE, SAYING AS MUCH AS THIS: GOD IS GRACIOUS AND GLADLY FORGIVES ALL SINS AND WILL GIVE ALL COMFORT, SO THAT WE MAY FIND ALL BLESSINGS AND COMFORT IN HIM. THEREFORE, THIS IS OPENLY A PSALM OF THANKS AND. AT THE SAME TIME, SECRETLY A PSALM OF COMFORTYES, EVEN A PSALM OF INSTRUCTION AND A PROPHECY. ALL IN ONE. IT PROCLAIMS GOD S GRACE AND TEACHES US TO TRUST AND BELIEVE IN HIM. TO THIS, MAY THE SAME MERCIFUL GOD HELP USOUR KING AND LORD.
