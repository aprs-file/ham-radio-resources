Psalm 23:1-6
The Lord is my shepherd 
	I shall not want. 
2 He makes me lie down in 
	green pastures. He leads me beside 
still waters He restores my soul.
He leads me in paths of righteousness 
	for his names sake. 
Even though I walk 
	through the valley of the shadow of death, 
	I will fear no evil, for you are I with me 
your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 
5 You prepare a table before me in the 
	presence of my enemies 
You anoint my head with oil 
My cup overflows. 
w Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me 
	all the days of my life, and I shall dwell 
in the house of the Lord forever. 
Psalm 118:1-4
1 Oh give thanks to the Lord, 
	for he is good
for his steadfast love endures forever! 
2 Let Israel say, 
	his steadfast love endures forever. 
3 Let the house of Aaron say, 
	his steadfast love endures forever. 
4 Let those who fear the Lord say,
	his steadfast love endures forever.
